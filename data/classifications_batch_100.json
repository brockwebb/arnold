    "reasoning": "This is a loaded-marching pattern with an anterior (bear-hug) load held at the chest. Primary movement is repeated single-leg locomotion (hip and knee flexion/extension, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) in the sagittal plane while maintaining an isometric anterior hold. The anterior load shifts center of mass forward and requires strong trunk bracing to prevent forward flexion and resist rotational forces during single-leg stance, producing anti-rotation demands. Upper-extremity joints maintain an isometric shoulder/elbow flexed/adducted position to secure the load.",
