## 90-90 Hip Switch
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:90_90_HIP_SWITCH
**search_query:** 90 90 hip switch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The 90/90 Hip Switch is a mobility drill primarily targeting hip internal and external rotation, working muscles like glutes (maximus, medius, minimus), TFL, hamstrings, obliques, and transversus abdominis to improve hip joint range of motion, pelvic control, and spinal stability, essential for functional movement. It teaches the hip to rotate efficiently within the joint, benefiting activities like running and squatting. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
This video demonstrates how to perform the 90/90 hip switch: 
Muscles Worked 

• Gluteus Maximus, Medius, & Minimus: Key hip extensors and stabilizers, involved in moving the leg and controlling pelvic tilt. 
• Tensor Fascia Latae (TFL): Assists with hip flexion and abduction. 
• Hamstrings: Contribute to pelvic tilt and hip extension. 
• Internal Obliques & Transversus Abdominis: Deep core muscles activated for pelvic stability and breathing control. 
• Hip External Rotators (e.g., Piriformis): Crucial for rotating the hip outward, often stretched in the back leg. 
• Hip Internal Rotators: Worked by the front leg's position, improving inward rotation. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Patterns & Goals 

• Hip Rotation: The core goal is to train the hip joint's ability to rotate internally and externally, moving the femur within the socket. 
• Pelvic Control: Establishes a stable pelvis by normalizing its position (often focusing on a posterior pelvic tilt). 
• Spinal Stability: Promotes neutral spine posture, preventing unwanted torso twisting during hip movements. 
• Breathing Integration: Often incorporates controlled breathing (inhale through nose, exhale through mouth) to engage deep core muscles. 
• Functional Mobility: Improves the fundamental movement pattern of hip flexion/extension with accompanying rotation, vital for athletic movement and daily life. [2, 3, 5, 8, 10]  

This video explains the importance of hip mobility and how to perform the 90/90 hip switch: 
How It Works 

1. Starting Position: Sit with one leg bent at 90 degrees in front (front hip internally rotated) and the other leg bent at 90 degrees behind (back hip externally rotated). 
2. The Switch: While maintaining support and a stable torso, lift your pelvis slightly and shift it to transition the legs to the opposite 90/90 position. 
3. Focus: The movement emphasizes rolling the thigh bone in the hip joint, not just swinging the legs side-to-side. [2, 3, 4, 9, 10]  

This video demonstrates how to perform the 90/90 hip switch with proper form:

## Active Hang
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:ACTIVE_HANG
**search_query:** active hang muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
An active hang works the upper back (lats, traps, rhomboids), shoulders, forearms/grip, and core, focusing on straight-arm scapular strength by pulling shoulder blades down and back, building stability for pull-ups and improving posture, unlike a passive hang which just relaxes the shoulders. The pattern is an isometric hold, requiring muscle tension to resist gravity, creating full-body engagement, especially in the shoulder girdle. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Back & Shoulders: Latissimus Dorsi (lats), Trapezius (traps), Rhomboids (scapular retractors). 
• Grip & Arms: Forearm flexors, hand muscles, biceps, triceps (isometric contraction). 
• Core: Abdominals and obliques (stabilization). [1, 4, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Start: Begin in a passive hang (shoulders relaxed to ears). 
2. Engage: Actively pull your shoulder blades down and away from your ears, as if trying to tuck them into your back pockets. 
3. Hold: Maintain straight arms and tension in your upper back and shoulders, resisting the pull of gravity. 
4. Isolate: Focus on scapular depression and retraction (pulling shoulder blades together and down) while keeping arms straight, not bending elbows. [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  

Benefits 

• Builds foundational strength for pull-ups and chin-ups. 
• Improves shoulder stability and health, especially for those with injuries. 
• Increases upper body endurance. 
• Corrects muscle imbalances. [1, 2, 4, 5]

## Arm Swings
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:ARM_SWINGS
**search_query:** arm swings warm up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Arm swings primarily work the shoulder muscles (deltoids, pectorals), upper back (traps, rhomboids), and chest, acting as a dynamic warm-up to improve mobility and circulation through shoulder flexion and adduction. The movement pattern involves rhythmic, alternating forward and backward motion, engaging shoulder girdle muscles to propel the arms across the body and return them, preparing joints for activity. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Deltoids (Anterior): Front of the shoulders, responsible for lifting the arm forward and across the body (flexion/horizontal adduction). 
    • Pectoralis Major (Sternal Head): Chest muscles, also involved in bringing the arms across the body (adduction). 
    • Serratus Anterior: Helps stabilize the shoulder blade. 

• Secondary & Stabilizers: 

    • Trapezius & Rhomboids: Upper back muscles that help stabilize the shoulder blades. 
    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Involved in pulling the arms down and back, especially in more dynamic versions. 
    • Triceps: Assist in extending the elbow and contributing to overall arm movement. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

• Action: A smooth, controlled oscillation of the arms, typically swinging them forward across the chest and then backward. 
• Coordination: Involves coordinated flexion and extension at the shoulder joint. 
• Purpose: To dynamically stretch muscles, increase blood flow, lubricate joints, and activate the nervous system for exercise. 
• Variations: Can range from gentle swings for mobility to more powerful swings (like with an RMT club or kettlebell) to build strength and stability, engaging the core and posterior chain more intensely. [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

## Bent-Over Plate Row
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:BENT_OVER_PLATE_ROW
**search_query:** bent over plate row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Bent-Over Plate Row is a powerful compound pull targeting your back (lats, traps, rhomboids), posterior shoulders (rear delts), and assisting muscles like biceps, while requiring significant core and lower back stabilization to maintain the hinged posture. The movement pattern involves a hip hinge (bending at the hips with a flat back), pulling the weight towards your abdomen by squeezing your shoulder blades together, and controlled lowering, emphasizing scapular retraction and elbow flexion. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
This video demonstrates the muscles worked and proper form for a bent-over row: 
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Primary Movers (Back & Shoulders): 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main back muscles for pulling your arms toward your body. 
    • Trapezius (Traps): Middle and lower traps help retract and depress the shoulder blades. 
    • Rhomboids: Located between the shoulder blades, they pull the shoulder blades together (retraction). 
    • Posterior Deltoids: The back part of your shoulder muscles, involved in pulling motions. 
    • Teres Major/Minor: Assist with shoulder extension and stability. 

• Stabilizers & Assisters: 

    • Erector Spinae (Lower Back): Contract to keep your torso stable and prevent rounding. 
    • Core Muscles (Abs): Brace to maintain trunk stability. 
    • Biceps (Biceps Brachii, Brachialis): Assist with elbow flexion (bending the elbow). 
    • Forearms: Grip the weight. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Watch this video to see the correct execution of the bent-over row: 
Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a weight (plate, barbell, or dumbbells) with an overhand grip, hands slightly wider than shoulders. 
2. Hinge: Hinge at your hips (like sitting back), keeping your back flat and knees slightly bent, until your torso is angled forward (around 45 degrees). 
3. Pull (Concentric): Pull the weight towards your lower chest or belly button by driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together. 
4. Hold: Pause briefly at the top, contracting the back muscles. 
5. Lower (Eccentric): Slowly lower the weight back to the starting position with extended arms, maintaining control. [1, 3, 7, 9]  

This video explains how to master the bent-over row technique: 
Key Cues 

• Keep your back straight and core tight. 
• Drive your elbows back, not just your hands. 
• Squeeze your shoulder blades at the top. 
• Control the weight on the way down. [1, 8]

## Burpee Dumbbell Deadlift
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:BURPEE_DUMBBELL_DEADLIFT
**search_query:** burpee dumbbell deadlift muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Burpee Dumbbell Deadlift is a full-body compound movement combining the explosive, full-body effort of a burpee with the strength-building hip hinge of a deadlift, working legs (glutes, quads, hamstrings), back (erectors, traps, lats), core, shoulders, and forearms, all within a dynamic pattern that integrates pushing, hinging, and lifting. It's excellent for strength, power, conditioning, and functional fitness by challenging the cardiovascular system while building muscle. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Back (Erector Spinae, Traps, Lats), Core (Abs). 
• Secondary/Stabilizers: Shoulders (Deltoids), Chest (Pectorals), Calves, Forearms. [1, 2, 4, 6]  

Movement Patterns 
This exercise combines several patterns into one continuous flow: 

1. Plank/Push-Up: Transitioning from standing to a plank/push-up position involves core stability, chest, and shoulder engagement. 
2. Hip Hinge (Deadlift): Sending hips back and bending knees slightly to grip dumbbells, engaging hamstrings and glutes. 
3. Hip Extension (Deadlift): Driving hips forward and standing tall, using glutes, hamstrings, and back to lift the weight. 
4. Explosive Power: The entire sequence builds power and raises the heart rate, making it a conditioning powerhouse. [2, 4, 5, 8, 9]  

How it Works Together 

• You start by dropping into a squat, placing hands on dumbbells (a hinge setup). 
• Kick back to a plank, then do a push-up (or just hold the plank). 
• Jump feet back in and immediately hinge at the hips to pick up the weights. 
• Stand up fully with the weights (deadlift). 
• Lower weights, kick back to plank, push-up, jump in, hinge, lift, repeat. [2, 7]

## Chain Overhead Press
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:CHAIN_OVERHEAD_PRESS
**search_query:** chain overhead press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Chain Overhead Press is a variation of the standard overhead press, primarily working the Shoulders (Deltoids), Triceps, and Upper Chest, with significant assistance from the Traps, Serratus Anterior, and Core for stabilization, engaging a vertical pushing movement pattern that builds upper body pushing strength and shoulder health. The chains add accommodating resistance, increasing intensity as you push up, challenging stability more than traditional weights. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Deltoids (Shoulders): Especially the anterior (front) deltoids, responsible for lifting the weight overhead. 
    • Triceps (Upper Arms): Extend the elbows to lock out the press. 
    • Pectoralis Major (Upper Chest): Assists in the initial pressing phase. 

• Secondary/Stabilizing Muscles: 

    • Trapezius (Upper Back): Stabilizes the shoulder girdle. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Helps move the shoulder blade and stabilize the joint. 
    • Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Essential for maintaining a rigid torso and preventing excessive arching of the lower back. 
    • Rotator Cuff: Stabilizes the shoulder joint throughout the movement. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern (Vertical Pushing) 

1. Starting Position: Bar (with chains) at shoulder height, hands gripping the bar, core braced, and glutes squeezed. 
2. Concentric (Pushing) Phase: Drive the weight upward by extending the elbows and shrugging the shoulders slightly, moving the head back as the bar passes the face. 
3. Top Position: Bar directly over the shoulders and mid-foot, arms fully extended. 
4. Eccentric (Lowering) Phase: Control the weight back down to the starting position, maintaining core tension. [6, 7, 8, 9]  

Key Considerations for Chains 

• Accommodating Resistance: As you lift, the chains come off the floor, increasing the resistance and forcing your muscles to work harder at the top of the movement, improving power. 
• Stability Challenge: The dynamic nature of chains requires more core and shoulder stability compared to a static weight, improving functional strength. [2, 5, 6, 8, 10]

## Dynamic Lunges
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:DYNAMIC_LUNGES
**search_query:** dynamic walking lunges muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Dynamic lunges primarily work your quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings, using hip/knee flexion/extension for movement, while engaging calves and core for stabilization and balance, promoting strength, power, and coordination in a single-leg pattern. Key movement patterns involve controlled steps, lowering into a split stance, and driving back up, with variations like walking or reverse lunges altering emphasis on posterior vs. anterior chain muscles. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Quadriceps: Front of the thigh, extending the knee to push up. 
    • Glutes (Gluteus Maximus): Buttocks, extending the hip and powering the ascent. 
    • Hamstrings: Back of the thigh, assisting hip extension and controlling knee flexion. 

• Stabilizers & Synergists: 

    • Calves (Gastrocnemius, Soleus): Help stabilize the ankle and push off. 
    • Hip Flexors: Control the forward/backward leg motion and stabilize the hip. 
    • Adductors: Inner thigh muscles assist in stability and movement. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Spinal Erectors): Maintain an upright torso and balance. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns 

• Phases: Lunges involve an eccentric phase (lengthening muscles to lower down) and a concentric phase (shortening muscles to push up). 
• Key Actions: Stepping (forward, backward, or laterally), lowering the hips, and driving back to the start. 
• Stance Variations: 

    • Shorter Stride: Emphasizes quads. 
    • Longer Stride/Reverse Lunge: Increases hamstring and glute engagement. 
    • Narrow Stance: Shifts focus to the anterior chain (quads). 
    • Wide Stance: Engages adductors more powerfully. 

• Dynamic Elements: Incorporating movement (walking lunges, jumping lunges) adds power and challenge, working arms and core more dynamically for balance and momentum. [2, 3, 5, 8, 9]  

How Variations Change Focus 

• Forward Lunge: Classic quad focus, but requires good balance. 
• Reverse Lunge: Easier on knees, greater hamstring/glute emphasis due to backward step. 
• Walking Lunge: Continuous movement, builds endurance. 
• Lunge with Twist: Adds core rotation and mobility work. [3, 5, 7, 10, 11]

## Eccentric Reverse Curl
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:ECCENTRIC_REVERSE_CURL
**search_query:** eccentric reverse curl muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Eccentric Reverse Curl primarily targets forearm muscles like the Brachioradialis and Brachialis, plus the Biceps Brachii, with a focus on the lowering phase (eccentric) for strength and control, using an overhand (pronated) grip for elbow flexion, strengthening grip, and building overall arm mass and definition, requiring core stability for proper form. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Brachioradialis: The main forearm muscle, highly activated by the pronated grip, assists in elbow flexion and wrist rotation. 
    • Brachialis: Sits under the biceps and is a powerful elbow flexor, pushing the biceps up as it develops. 

• Secondary Muscles: 

    • Biceps Brachii: Still involved in elbow flexion, but the forearm muscles take precedence with the overhand grip. 
    • Core & Upper Back: Isometrically contract to keep your torso stable and upright. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern (Eccentric Focus): 

1. Starting Position: Stand or sit holding a barbell or dumbbells with an overhand (palms facing down) grip, hands shoulder-width apart. 
2. Concentric (Lifting Phase - Optional): Flex your elbows to curl the weight towards your shoulders, squeezing the muscles. 
3. Eccentric (Lowering Phase - The Focus): Slowly and with control, lower the weight back to the starting position, resisting gravity as the forearm muscles lengthen under tension. 
4. Key Technique: Keep elbows tucked in, wrists straight, and control the entire range of motion for maximum muscle engagement and to prevent injury. [3, 4, 8, 9, 10]  

Why Eccentric? 

• Focusing on the eccentric (lowering) phase builds strength, muscle size (hypertrophy), and improves control, making it great for preventing injuries and enhancing overall arm development, say experts at PureGym (https://www.puregym.com/exercises/arms-and-shoulders/bicep-curl/pronated-bicep-curls/) and Speediance (https://www.speediance.com/blogs/fitness/how-to-do-reverse-curls).

Floor Angels primarily work your upper back and shoulder muscles (rhomboids, traps, rear delts, rotator cuff) to improve posture and shoulder mobility by strengthening back stabilizers and stretching chest muscles (pectorals) through controlled arm movements from a 'W' to a 'Y' or overhead position while keeping your back flat. The movement pattern is a controlled overhead reach and return, focusing on scapular retraction and protraction to flatten shoulder blades and open the chest. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers/Stabilizers: Middle and lower trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoids, serratus anterior, rotator cuff. 
• Stretched Muscles: Pectorals (chest). [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]  

Movement Pattern (Scapular Control) 

1. Starting Position: Lie on your back, knees bent (crook lying), arms in a 'W' shape (elbows bent at 90 degrees, forearms up). Keep your lower back pressed to the floor (slight pelvic tuck). 
2. Upward Motion: Slowly slide your arms overhead into a 'Y' or straight line, keeping elbows, wrists, and forearms on the floor as much as possible, engaging your back muscles to keep shoulders down and back. 
3. Downward Motion: Reverse the movement, sliding arms back to the 'W' position, focusing on controlled scapular retraction (pulling shoulder blades together) and depression (pulling them down). [2, 4, 6, 8]  

Key Focus Points 

• Control: Slow, deliberate movements. 
• No Arching: Maintain a neutral spine and avoid lifting your low back off the floor. 
• Full Contact: Keep arms and hands in contact with the floor throughout the movement for maximum benefit. [1, 2, 4, 8]

## Hip Hinge
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:HIP_HINGE
**search_query:** hip hinge exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The hip hinge is a fundamental movement pattern focusing on bending at the hips, keeping a neutral spine, and engaging the posterior chain: glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, with core stabilization. It involves pushing the hips back (like bowing) and returning by driving the hips forward, crucial for daily tasks and exercises like deadlifts, promoting strength and injury prevention by loading the glutes and hamstrings, not just the spine. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked (Posterior Chain) 

• Glutes (Gluteus Maximus): Primary movers for hip extension (driving back up). 
• Hamstrings: Key for hip flexion (bending forward) and extension, stretching and contracting. 
• Erector Spinae (Lower Back): Maintain spinal neutrality, preventing rounding. 
• Core (Abs, Obliques): Brace the torso, stabilizing the spine. 
• Lats & Grip (for weighted versions): Help keep the upper body stable and connected. [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Start: Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, slight bend in knees, core braced, spine neutral. 
2. Hinge (Forward): Initiate by pushing your hips backward (like a door hinge), keeping your back flat and knees soft but relatively still. 
3. Lower: Lower your torso until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings or reach a comfortable depth, maintaining spinal neutrality. 
4. Return (Up): Drive your hips forward, squeezing your glutes to return to the starting upright position. [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]  

Key Concept 

• Hip-Driven vs. Knee-Driven: Unlike a squat (knee bend), the hinge moves primarily from the hip joint, loading the muscles on the back of your body. [1, 2]

## Isometric Push-Up Hold
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:ISOMETRIC_PUSH_UP_HOLD
**search_query:** isometric push up hold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
An Isometric Push-Up Hold builds static strength in the chest (pectorals), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps, while intensely engaging the core (abs, obliques) and back stabilizers (lats, serratus anterior) to maintain a rigid, straight body line, preventing sagging and promoting joint stability through sustained tension, not movement. The movement pattern is a static, closed-chain push, requiring significant core bracing and focus on maintaining proper alignment (hollow body, tucked elbows) against gravity. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pushing Muscles): 

    • Pectoralis Major: The chest muscles, heavily recruited to push against the floor. 
    • Anterior Deltoids: Front of the shoulders, assisting in arm extension. 
    • Triceps: Back of the upper arms, extending the elbow joint. 

• Stabilizers: 

    • Core (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis): Braces the spine and pelvis, preventing sagging. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Helps protract the shoulder blades and stabilize the shoulder girdle. 
    • Latissimus Dorsi: Back muscles that help keep elbows tucked in (imagining holding pencils). 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Engaged to keep the legs locked and the body straight. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern 

• Type: Isometric (static contraction with no joint movement). 
• Action: Holding a fixed position, typically halfway down in a push-up (chest just above the floor) or at the top. 
• Key Cues: 

    • Maintain a straight line from head to heels (no sagging hips or piking). 
    • Engage the core and squeeze the glutes. 
    • Keep elbows tucked at about a 45-degree angle, not flared out. 
    • Actively push the floor away (or hold tension) to keep muscles engaged. 

• Benefit: Increases time under tension, builds foundational strength, improves joint stability, and enhances mind-muscle connection, making dynamic push-ups feel easier. [2, 3, 9, 10, 11]

**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:JUMPING_JACK
**search_query:** jumping jacks muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Jumping jacks are a full-body cardio exercise engaging calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes (lower body), deltoids, and shoulder muscles (upper body) for propulsion and arm movement, alongside core and hip stabilizers; the movement pattern involves rhythmic jumping (hip/knee/ankle extension) and arm abduction/adduction (raising/lowering arms), requiring coordination and working as a plyometric warm-up or conditioning exercise. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Lower Body: Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus), Quadriceps (vastus muscles), Hamstrings, Glutes. 
• Upper Body: Shoulders (deltoids, supraspinatus), Arms (biceps/triceps stabilize). 
• Core & Hips: Core muscles, Hip abductors, Hip flexors for stability and movement control. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns (Phases): 

1. Starting Position: Standing with feet together, arms at sides. 
2. Upward/Outward (Propel/Abduction): 

    • Jumping feet out wide (hip and knee extension). 
    • Swinging arms overhead (shoulder abduction). 

3. Middle Position (Peak): Feet wide, arms overhead, body engaged. 
4. Downward/Inward (Return/Adduction): 

    • Jumping feet back together (hip and knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion for landing). 
    • Bringing arms back down to sides (shoulder adduction). 

5. Rhythm: This cycle repeats continuously, making it a great plyometric and cardiovascular exercise. [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]

## Landmine Anti-Rotation Press
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:LANDMINE_ANTI_ROTATION_PRESS
**search_query:** landmine anti rotation press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Landmine Anti-Rotation Press works your shoulders (deltoids), chest (pectorals), triceps, and crucially, your entire core (obliques, abs, deep stabilizers) to prevent torso rotation as you press the angled barbell, building unilateral pushing strength and core stability through a single-arm, diagonal pushing movement pattern. It’s a functional exercise that challenges your body to resist movement, improving posture and athletic power by locking down your hips and spine while your arms work. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pushing): 

    • Deltoids: Especially anterior (front) and medial (side) heads. 
    • Pectoralis Major (Chest): Assists in pushing the weight forward. 
    • Triceps: Extend the elbow to lock out the press. 

• Stabilizers (Anti-Rotation & Core): 

    • Obliques: Work intensely to prevent your torso from twisting. 
    • Rectus Abdominis & Transverse Abdominis: Brace to keep your spine stable. 
    • Glutes: Engage to keep your hips stable and prevent tilting. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Stabilizes the shoulder blade, crucial for a smooth bar path. [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand or kneel (half-kneeling is common) facing the landmine, holding one end of the barbell with one hand at chest height. 
2. The Press: Brace your core and glutes, then press the barbell diagonally forward and up, extending your arm fully. 
3. Anti-Rotation: Actively resist the bar pulling your torso to the side; keep your hips and shoulders square to the front. 
4. Return: Control the weight back down in the same angled path. 
5. Pattern: A single-arm diagonal press that forces anti-rotation, challenging core stability and fixing strength imbalances. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]

## Neural Floss
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:NEURAL_FLOSS
**search_query:** nerve flossing muscles worked benefits
**retrieved_at:** 
Nerve flossing (or gliding) targets major nerves (Median, Ulnar, Radial, Sciatic) by using gentle, alternating movements to help them slide through tight tissues, not primarily working muscles, but mobilizing nerves, improving blood flow, and restoring function, often alleviating pain/tingling from conditions like sciatica or carpal tunnel by reducing nerve compression, using movement patterns like extending/flexing joints to relieve tension along the nerve's path. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked (Indirectly) 

• Nerve flossing focuses on the nerves themselves, but the surrounding muscles facilitate the movements, including: 

    • Upper Body: Shoulder depressors/elevators, elbow flexors/extensors (triceps/biceps), wrist/finger extensors/flexors (forearm muscles). 
    • Lower Body: Hip flexors/extensors, hamstrings, glutes, calf muscles, depending on the nerve being flossed (e.g., sciatic nerve). [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns (Nerve Gliding) 

• Principle: Creates a back-and-forth motion, alternately lengthening and shortening the nerve's path, unlike a static stretch. 
• Key Patterns: 

    • Tension & Release: Gently pulling one end of the nerve taut (e.g., extending elbow) and then relaxing it (e.g., flexing elbow/wrist). 
    • Glide & Slide: Moving joints in sequence to help the nerve "floss" through surrounding muscle and fascia. 

• Examples by Nerve: 

    • Sciatic Nerve: Sitting/standing, extending/flexing the knee and ankle, or tilting head while moving leg. 
    • Median/Ulnar/Radial Nerves (Arm): Moving shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers together in a coordinated sequence (e.g., depressing shoulder, flexing elbow, extending wrist/fingers). [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Goal & Sensation 

• Goal: Improve nerve mobility, reduce adhesions/inflammation, restore blood flow, relieve pain/tingling/numbness. 
• Sensation: Should feel like a gentle tension or "glide," not sharp pain; any numbness/tingling should disappear quickly after the movement. [1, 5, 8, 11, 12]

## Neutral-Grip Hang Knees-Up
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:NEUTRAL_GRIP_HANG_KNEES_UP
**search_query:** hanging knee raise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Neutral-Grip Hang Knees-Up targets your abs (rectus abdominis, obliques), hip flexors, and builds grip/forearm strength, with your lats, shoulders, and serratus anterior stabilizing isometrically; the movement pattern involves controlled hip and spinal flexion (pulling knees up) while resisting momentum and arching the back, promoting full-body stability and core power through a functional, full-range motion. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Core): 

    • Rectus Abdominis: The "six-pack" muscle, responsible for spinal flexion (bringing torso towards legs). 
    • Obliques (Internal & External): Stabilize the torso and resist rotation, crucial for core stability. 
    • Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas): Lift the knees toward the chest. 

• Stabilizers & Support: 

    • Forearms & Hands: Maintain grip on the bar. 
    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Engage to keep the body stable and prevent swinging. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Assists in shoulder girdle stability. 
    • Glutes & Lower Back: Engage to prevent arching and maintain a hollow body. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  

Movement Pattern & Technique 

1. Starting Position (Active Hang): Hang from the bar with palms facing each other (neutral grip), shoulders engaged (not slumped), and feet off the floor, creating a stable "hollow body" position. 
2. Concentric (Upward) Phase: Exhale as you initiate the movement by flexing your hips and spine, driving your knees up towards your chest, aiming for 90 degrees at the hips. 
3. Peak Contraction: Squeeze your abs at the top; the higher you lift, the more lower abdominal/pelvic rotation engages the abs. 
4. Eccentric (Downward) Phase: Inhale as you slowly and with control lower your legs back to the starting position, resisting gravity to prevent swinging. 
5. Key Technique: Focus on pulling with your abs, not just your hip flexors, and avoid arching your lower back or using momentum. [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Pigeon Pose
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:PIGEON_POSE
**search_query:** pigeon pose muscles stretched worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Pigeon Pose primarily stretches the hip flexors, glutes, and deep hip rotators (like the piriformis) on the front leg, while lengthening the psoas of the back leg, improving hip mobility and releasing lower back tension. The movement pattern involves hip flexion (front leg) and extension (back leg) with external rotation of the front hip, requiring core stability and spinal support, making it a powerful hip opener. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked/Stretched 

• Front Leg (Bent): 

    • Glutes (Maximus, Medius, Minimus): Stretches the buttock muscles, aiding in hip extension and stability. 
    • Piriformis & Deep Hip Rotators: Releases tension in these muscles that rotate the thigh outward. 
    • Inner Thighs (Adductors): Helps to stabilize the leg. 

• Back Leg (Extended): 

    • Hip Flexors (Iliacus, Psoas): Lengthens these muscles at the front of the hip, crucial for stability and flexibility, especially after sitting. 
    • Quadriceps: A gentle stretch in the front of the thigh. 

• Core & Back: 

    • Spinal Erectors: Engaged to support the spine, especially in deeper variations. 
    • Core Muscles: Provide stability for the torso. [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Hip Flexion & External Rotation (Front Leg): The front thigh bends and rotates outward in the hip socket. 
2. Hip Extension (Back Leg): The back leg extends straight behind you, lengthening the hip flexors. 
3. Spinal Stability & Flexion (Torso): The torso can remain upright (spinal extension) or fold forward (spinal flexion), requiring core engagement to maintain balance and support the lower back. [2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Key Takeaway 
Pigeon Pose is a deep hip opener that targets flexibility and mobility in the glutes and hip flexors, making it excellent for relieving lower back pain and improving overall hip health, but it requires careful attention to knee and lower back alignment to avoid injury. [1, 2, 5, 6]

The Push-Up with Sandbag Drag is a compound, full-body exercise that blends pushing (chest, shoulders, triceps) with anti-rotation and core stabilization (abs, obliques, lower back) and hip/leg engagement (glutes, hamstrings) to build power, core strength, and stability, progressing towards single-arm push-ups by challenging the body to maintain a rigid plank while shifting load laterally. It combines a standard push-up (pushing pattern) with a plank lateral drag (stabilization/anti-rotation pattern), targeting chest, shoulders, triceps, core, lats, and hips. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pushing): Chest (Pectorals), Shoulders (Deltoids), Triceps. 
• Stabilizers/Core: Core (Transverse Abdominis, Obliques), Lower Back, Serratus Anterior. 
• Dynamic Stabilizers (Drag): Glutes, Hamstrings, Lats, Forearms (for grip). [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]  

This video demonstrates how to perform a sandbag lateral drag: 
Movement Patterns 

• Pushing: The standard push-up portion involves elbow flexion and extension (pushing) to move the body up and down. 
• Anti-Rotation/Stabilization: The drag requires significant anti-rotation, where the core and supporting shoulder/hip resist the bag's shifting weight, preventing hip or torso rotation. 
• Pulling/Scapular Movement (Drag): Reaching and pulling the bag engages the lats and challenges shoulder stability. 
• Full-Body Integration: Connects the core to the limbs, building functional strength for real-life movements by training the body to move as a unit, notes BrickHouse Nutrition (https://brickhousenutrition.com/blogs/articles/sandbag-training-101-is-this-the-ultimate-full-body-workout-tool) and Ultimate Sandbag Training (https://ultimatesandbagtraining.com/10-ultimate-sandbag-exercises-that-are-musts/). [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]  

This video shows a variation of the exercise with a dumbbell: 
How It Works (The Drag) 

1. Start: Begin in a high plank with your feet wide and the sandbag beside one hand. 
2. Reach & Drag: Reach across your body with the opposite hand, grab the bag, and slowly drag it under your torso to the other side, keeping hips level and core tight. 
3. Push-Up: As the bag crosses, lower into a one-arm push-up, then press back up, maintaining tension. 
4. Alternate: Repeat the drag and push-up on the other side, creating a powerful, unstable workout. [1, 4, 9, 10]

## Quad Raise
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:QUAD_RAISE
**search_query:** quad raise exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
A "Quad Raise" (often the Quadruped Leg Raise) primarily targets core/abs, glutes, and hamstrings for stabilization, while the Leg Extension (or seated leg raise) directly works the quadriceps (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis/Lateralis/Intermedius) to extend the knee, with the movement pattern being knee extension, essential for jumping, squatting, and walking. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 
For the Quadruped Leg Raise (Stabilization) 

• Core: Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis (deep core). 
• Glutes: Gluteus Maximus, Medius, Minimus (for hip stability). 
• Hamstrings: (Synergistically) for stabilizing the knee and hip. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

For the Leg Extension (Direct Quad Work) 

• Rectus Femoris: Extends knee, flexes hip. 
• Vastus Medialis: Extends knee, stabilizes kneecap (teardrop muscle). 
• Vastus Lateralis: Extends knee, creates quad sweep. 
• Vastus Intermedius: Deepest quad muscle, extends knee. [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns 

• Quadruped Leg Raise: A stabilization pattern focusing on anti-rotation and maintaining a neutral spine while extending one arm and opposite leg, working core endurance and hip/glute control. 
• Leg Extension: A classic knee extension pattern, involving straightening the leg at the knee joint (like kicking or standing up) and hip flexion (lifting the thigh) for the rectus femoris. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]  

Key Difference 

• Quadruped Raise: A core/stability exercise that indirectly involves the quads for stabilization. 
• Leg Extension: A direct quad isolation exercise focused on building strength and size in the front thigh muscles. [1, 3, 6, 9]

## Sand Duffle Strict Press
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SAND_DUFFLE_STRICT_PRESS
**search_query:** sandbag strict press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Sandbag Strict Press is a compound, full-body movement building upper-body pushing strength (delts, triceps, chest), core stability (abs, lower back), and leg drive, with the unstable sandbag load enhancing stabilizer muscles and functional strength compared to barbells, forcing greater core engagement and shoulder girdle stabilization through the entire pressing pattern from front rack to overhead lockout. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pushing): 

    • Deltoids (Shoulders): Especially the anterior (front) delts, but also lateral and rear delts for stability. 
    • Triceps: Extend the elbow to lock out the weight overhead. 
    • Pectorals (Chest): Assist in pressing. 

• Stabilizers & Support: 

    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Lower Back): Braces the spine and pelvis to prevent arching and maintain a stable torso. 
    • Traps (Trapezius): Help stabilize the shoulder girdle. 
    • Upper Back (Rhomboids, Lats): Support shoulder stability. 
    • Glutes & Legs: Provide a solid base and drive power from the ground up (leg drive). 
    • Forearms & Grip: Hold the sandbag securely. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns (Pushing Pattern) 

1. Setup (Clean): Lift the sandbag to the front rack position (resting on shoulders/chest). 
2. Descent (Eccentric): Brace core, maintain upright chest, and keep the sandbag stable as you transition from front rack to the start. 
3. Press (Concentric): 

    • Drive with legs (slight dip/stomp). 
    • Drive the sandbag upward, keeping elbows in. 
    • Drive your head through at the top (like shrugging forward) to get it overhead. 
    • Lock out elbows with biceps by ears. 

4. Return (Eccentric): Control the descent back to the front rack position, resetting for the next rep. [6, 7, 8, 9]  

Sandbag Specifics 

• Instability: The shifting weight forces greater stabilizer muscle recruitment in the shoulders and core. 
• Unpredictable Load: Requires constant adjustment, improving neuromuscular coordination. [4, 10]

## Sandbag Clean
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SANDBAG_CLEAN
**search_query:** sandbag clean muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Sandbag Clean is a total-body power movement working legs (quads, hamstrings, glutes), back (lats, traps, erectors), core (obliques, abs), shoulders (deltoids), arms, and grip, involving a hip-driven, explosive pull from the floor to the shoulders, mimicking real-life lifting, challenging stability, and building functional strength. Key patterns include the Deadlift pull, explosive Hip Extension, and dynamic Catch, requiring coordination, core bracing, and grip strength due to the unstable weight. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Legs: Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes (powering the initial lift). 
• Back: Traps, Lats, Erector Spinae (stabilizing and assisting the pull). 
• Core: Obliques, Abdominals (crucial for stability and transferring force). 
• Shoulders & Arms: Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms (catching and controlling the bag). 
• Grip: Forearms and hands (essential for holding the awkward, shifting load). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns 

1. Deadlift/Pull: Starting from the floor in a hip-hinge position, pulling the bag up your legs. 
2. Explosive Hip Drive: A powerful, rapid extension of the hips and knees to generate upward momentum. 
3. Scoop/Catch: Quickly pulling your elbows forward and rotating under the bag to catch it in the "front rack" position (resting on forearms/biceps). 
4. Front Squat Transition (Optional): Dropping into a front squat to receive the bag before standing up. 
5. Stabilization: Constant core bracing and activation to manage the shifting weight and maintain posture. [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]  

Key Aspects 

• Total-Body Power: Develops explosive strength and coordination. 
• Functional Fitness: Mimics lifting awkward objects. 
• Core & Stabilizers: The unstable load heavily taxes the core and smaller stabilizing muscles. 
• Grip Strength: A major benefit due to the lack of fixed handles. [1, 2, 4]

## Sandbag Crush Press
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SANDBAG_CRUSH_PRESS
**search_query:** sandbag crush grip press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Sandbag Crush Press primarily targets your chest (pectorals), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps, working in a pressing/pushing pattern with significant core stabilization due to the unstable weight, engaging stabilizers and teaching proper shoulder/core coordination by forcing you to "crush" or "rip" the bag apart to maintain tension, much like a heavy dumbbell bench press but with added instability. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Pectoralis Major (chest), Anterior Deltoids (front shoulders), Triceps Brachii (back of arms). 
• Stabilizers: Core (abdominals, obliques, erector spinae), Lats, Rotator Cuff. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern & Key Focus 

1. Setup: Start with the sandbag on your lap (for floor press) or front rack position (for standing press), feet stable. 
2. Pressing Motion: Press the bag upward (or overhead), similar to a dumbbell press, but with a key difference: you actively squeeze the bag, trying to pull it apart or "crush" it. 
3. Coordination: This "crush" action creates tension, teaching your lats and core to stabilize the shoulder joint, preventing the elbows from flaring out and shoulders from rounding forward, a common issue in traditional presses. 
4. Dynamic Instability: The shifting weight forces constant muscle recruitment, making it a more functional movement that improves mind-muscle connection and overall stability. [2, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

Variations (for context) 

• Floor Press: Lying on your back, pressing up from the floor, emphasizing chest and triceps. 
• Overhead Press: From a front rack, pressing the bag overhead, engaging more shoulders, core, and legs for stability. [2, 7, 9]

## Seated Straight Leg Swing Over Object
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SEATED_STRAIGHT_LEG_SWING_OVER_OBJECT
**search_query:** seated leg swings over hurdle muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Seated Straight Leg Swing Over Object primarily works the hip flexors, quadriceps, and core muscles. The movement pattern involved is a combination of hip flexion, abduction, and adduction while maintaining knee extension and core stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Hip Flexors: These are the main muscles responsible for lifting the leg and moving it over the object. Key muscles include the iliopsoas (iliacus and psoas major) and rectus femoris. 
    • Quadriceps: All four quadriceps muscles (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius) engage isometrically to keep the leg straight throughout the entire movement. 
    • Core Muscles: The abdominal muscles (especially the lower abs) and lower back muscles work to stabilize the pelvis and torso, particularly when minimizing the use of hands for support. 

• Secondary/Stabilizer Muscles: 

    • Hip Adductors: These inner thigh muscles help control the leg's movement toward the midline of the body (adduction) as it swings over and down the other side of the object. 
    • Hip Abductors: These muscles (like the gluteus medius) are involved in moving the leg away from the body's midline (abduction) and stabilizing the pelvis. 
    • Glutes: The gluteus maximus is engaged to assist with hip stability. 
    • Sartorius and Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL): These also assist in the hip movement. [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Movement Patterns 
The exercise incorporates several fundamental movement patterns related to lower body and core control: 

• Hip Flexion/Extension: The primary action involves lifting and lowering the leg, which is a key function of the hip flexors. 
• Hip Abduction/Adduction: As the leg is raised and moved over the object, it performs abduction (moving away from the midline) and then adduction (moving back toward the midline). 
• Core Stabilization: Maintaining an upright or slightly leaned-back posture requires significant core engagement, which is a crucial aspect of this exercise. 
• Knee Extension (Isometric): The quadriceps remain contracted throughout the movement to maintain a straight leg. [7, 8, 14, 15, 16]  

The "Seated Straight Leg Swing Over Object" is an effective low-impact exercise for enhancing hip strength, mobility, and core stability, often used in physical therapy and as a preparatory exercise for more advanced movements like the L-sit. [7, 17]

**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SINGLE_LEG_TOE_TOUCHES
**search_query:** single leg toe touch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Single-Leg Toe Touches primarily target the hamstrings, glutes, and core (abs), while improving balance, stability, and hip mobility through a hip-hinge pattern, working muscles dynamically for stretching and strengthening, especially the posterior chain and stabilizers, and enhancing proprioception for better body awareness. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Hamstrings: (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) – Key muscles for stretching and eccentric control. 
• Glutes: (Gluteus Maximus) – Activates to help drive you back up and stabilize the hip. 
• Core: (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis) – Stabilizes the torso and prevents excessive spinal rounding. 
• Calves & Ankles: Act as stabilizers during the single-leg stance. 
• Lower Back: (Spinal Erectors) – Involved in maintaining spinal posture during the hinge. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Stand on one leg, keeping a slight bend in the supporting knee; the other leg is lifted behind you. 
2. The Hinge: Hinge forward at the hip (not by rounding the spine), reaching the opposite hand towards the floor or your standing foot. 
3. Dynamic Stretch: Feel the stretch in the hamstring of the standing leg and the glute/lower back of the lifted leg. 
4. Return: Drive through the glute and hamstring to return to the starting position, squeezing at the top.

**search_query:** spiderman lunge stretch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Spiderman Lunges are a dynamic mobility exercise primarily targeting hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings, and inner thighs (adductors), while also engaging the core, lower back, and even chest/shoulders (especially with rotations) for stabilization, improving overall hip flexibility and range of motion from a high plank position with forward foot placement and deep hip movement. The movement pattern involves transitioning from a plank, stepping one foot outside the hand, and deepening the lunge, often adding torso rotations for a full-body stretch and core engagement. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
This video demonstrates the basic Spiderman Lunge: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers/Stretch Targets: Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas), Glutes (Maximus, Medius), Hamstrings, Adductors (inner thighs). 
• Stabilizers/Secondary: Core (Abdominals, Obliques), Lower Back, Chest, Shoulders, Triceps (especially with rotation variations). [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern & Benefits 

• Start: High plank position, hands under shoulders, body in a straight line. 
• Action: Step one foot forward to the outside of the hand, lowering hips. 
• Deepening (Optional): Lower elbow/forearm towards the instep (same side as front foot) for a deeper stretch. 
• Rotation (Optional): Extend the same arm towards the ceiling, rotating the torso. 
• Return: Push off the front foot to return to the plank. 
• Key Benefit: Great for unlocking tight hips, improving hamstring/hip flexor flexibility, and core stabilization during movement. [2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11]

## Spinal Decompression
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:SPINAL_DECOMPRESSION
**search_query:** spinal decompression hang muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Spinal decompression primarily works by reducing tension in the erector spinae, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles, creating space between vertebrae, and improving circulation, not directly building muscle, but allowing them to function better. The movement pattern involves controlled stretching (flexion, extension, lateral bending, rotation) to relieve pressure, often using variable pull-relax cycles to prevent muscle guarding, enhancing overall spinal mobility and stability when combined with strengthening exercises. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked (Indirectly & Supportively) 
Spinal decompression aims to relax muscles that guard the spine and promote healing in deep supportive tissues, rather than isolating them for strength training. 

• Spinal Stabilizers: Relieves tension in the erector spinae (longissimus, iliocostalis, spinalis) and deep multifidus, allowing them to function better. 
• Core Muscles: Reduces spasms and improves function in the abdominals and obliques, which support the spine. 
• Glutes & Hamstrings: Stretches tight hamstrings and piriformis, which can pull on the pelvis and lower back. [1, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns 
The therapy uses controlled, cyclical movements to achieve decompression. 

• Variable Tension: Instead of constant pulling (traction), decompression uses cycles of stretch and release to relax muscles and prevent guarding. 
• Spinal Elongation: Creates negative pressure to draw disc material back in and decompress nerve roots. 
• Flexion & Extension: Gentle forward (flexion) and backward (extension) bending movements. 
• Lateral Bending & Rotation: Some protocols incorporate side bending and twisting to target specific spinal segments. [3, 6, 9, 10, 11]  

How it Helps Muscles & Movement 

• Reduces Muscle Spasm & Guarding: The gentle stretching relaxes tight muscles that reflexively contract due to pain. 
• Improves Circulation: Creates suction to bring nutrients and oxygen to discs, aiding muscle recovery. 
• Restores Mobility: Allows for a greater range of motion (flexion, extension, etc.). 
• Foundation for Strengthening: By alleviating pain, it enables patients to perform targeted core and back exercises to build lasting stability. [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12]

## Sternum-to-Bar Isometric Hold
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:STERNUM_TO_BAR_ISOMETRIC_HOLD
**search_query:** sternum to bar pull up hold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
A Sternum-to-Bar Isometric Hold, a variation of the Chest-to-Bar Pull-up, intensely activates your back (lats, rhomboids, traps), biceps, rear delts, forearms, and core (abs/obliques), holding at the top where your sternum touches the bar. This isometric (no movement) hold builds static strength and time under tension, focusing on deep mid-back engagement, scapular stability, and core bracing, making it excellent for developing pulling power for advanced calisthenics. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Back: Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius (upper/mid). 
• Arms: Biceps, Brachialis, Brachioradialis (forearms). 
• Shoulders: Rear Deltoids, Rotator Cuff. 
• Core: Rectus Abdominis, Transverse Abdominis, Obliques (for torso stability). [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern & Key Focus 

1. Isometrics: The hold involves creating tension in the muscles without changing their length (no joint movement). 
2. Scapular Retraction & Depression: You're actively pulling your shoulder blades down and back (retraction) to bring the chest to the bar, engaging the mid-back. 
3. Elbow Flexion & Adduction: Biceps and lats work hard to keep the elbows bent and pulled back towards your body. 
4. Core Bracing: Your abdominals contract to prevent your lower back from arching (lumbar extension), keeping your torso stable. 
5. Time Under Tension: The goal is to hold this peak contraction for a set duration (e.g., 10-30 seconds), building strength in that specific pulling position. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

How It Differs from Regular Pull-ups 

• Increased Range of Motion (ROM): Reaching the sternum requires pulling higher than a standard pull-up. 
• Greater Mid-Back Activation: More focus on upper back and scapular control. 
• Builds Strength in a Weak Point: Strengthens the top, most challenging part of the pull-up. [2, 8]

## Thoracic Extensions
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:THORACIC_EXTENSIONS
**search_query:** thoracic extension exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Thoracic extension works muscles like the Erector Spinae group, Trapezius, and Rhomboids, improving posture and upper body mobility by straightening the upper back, while the movement pattern involves arching the mid-back backward, distinct from lumbar (lower back) movement, often combined with shoulder blade retraction, crucial for overhead movements and reducing shoulder strain. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Erector Spinae Group: The primary extensors, including the Spinalis, responsible for extending the spine. 
• Trapezius (Middle & Lower): Helps elevate and retract the shoulder blades (scapulae) during extension. 
• Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Work with the traps to pull the shoulder blades together. 
• Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): While involved in pulling, they also influence thoracic position and can be tight in those lacking extension. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

• Extension: The movement involves arching the upper back (thoracic spine) backward, away from flexion (rounding forward). 
• Scapular Retraction: Often paired with squeezing the shoulder blades together for stability. 
• Isolation: Key is to isolate the upper back movement, preventing compensation (arching) from the lower (lumbar) spine or neck. 
• Combined Motions: Can be combined with rotation or side-bending for more complex patterns. [4, 5, 7, 8, 9]  

Why It's Important 

• Reduces Lower Back Pain: Takes strain off the lumbar spine by allowing it to move more naturally. 
• Improves Shoulder Function: Provides a stable base for the shoulder blades, crucial for overhead pressing, throwing, and pulling. 
• Enhances Posture: Counteracts slouching and rounded shoulders from prolonged sitting. [4, 5, 10, 11]

## Tucked Hang
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:TUCKED_HANG
**search_query:** tucked hang muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
A Tucked Hang (or Hanging Knee Tuck) primarily targets your core (abs, obliques), hip flexors, and grip strength (forearms), while also engaging the lats and upper back for stability; the movement pattern involves a controlled lift of the knees to the chest (hip flexion/spinal flexion) from a dead hang, requiring isometric strength and control to prevent swinging. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary: 

    • Rectus Abdominis & Transverse Abdominis: For spinal flexion and core bracing. 
    • Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas): To bring the knees up. 
    • Forearms: For grip endurance. 

• Secondary/Stabilizers: 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Engage to keep the body stable and control the descent. 
    • Obliques: For rotational stability (especially in twisting variations) and core bracing. 
    • Scapular Stabilizers (Rhomboids, Traps): To keep shoulders down and packed. 
    • Biceps: Isometrically to stabilize the arms. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns 

1. Start: Begin in a full dead hang, gripping the bar with palms facing forward (or neutral grip for more lat activation). 
2. Engage: Pull your shoulder blades down (scapular depression) and brace your core, tucking your pelvis slightly. 
3. Lift (Hip & Spinal Flexion): Drive your knees up towards your chest (thighs parallel to the floor or higher), bending at the hips and flexing the spine. 
4. Control: Lower back down slowly and with resistance, preventing your body from swinging like a pendulum. 
5. Core Focus: Think about rounding your spine and bringing your pelvis to your ribs, rather than just pulling with your legs. [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]  

This exercise is excellent for building foundational core and grip strength needed for more advanced calisthenics like L-sits and front levers. [1, 7]

Muscles Worked 

• Primary: Upper Traps, Rhomboids, Serratus Anterior, Deltoids (shoulder), Rotator Cuff muscles. 
• Secondary/Stabilizers: Core muscles (abs), Hamstrings, Lower Traps. [1, 2, 3, 4]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand with your back, head, shoulders, and hips against a wall, feet a few inches away, knees slightly bent. 
2. Starting Position: Arms bent at 90 degrees (like a goalpost), backs of arms, hands, and elbows touching the wall. 
3. Ascending Phase (Upward Motion): Slowly slide your arms overhead, aiming to keep your elbows, wrists, and hands in contact with the wall, mimicking a snow angel motion. 
4. Descending Phase (Downward Motion): Slowly lower your arms back to the starting 90-degree position, maintaining wall contact. 
5. Focus: The movement emphasizes smooth, controlled scapular (shoulder blade) upward and downward rotation, along with shoulder flexion and extension, while fighting the urge to lift your lower back off the wall. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

Benefits 

• Strengthens postural muscles to combat desk hunching. 
• Increases shoulder and thoracic (mid-back) mobility. 
• Helps retrain proper shoulder blade positioning. 
• Improves spinal alignment and reduces neck/shoulder tension. [3, 5, 7, 8, 9]

## Weighted Plank
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:WEIGHTED_PLANK
**search_query:** weighted plank muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
A weighted plank is an isometric exercise primarily targeting deep core muscles (transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, obliques) for stability, but also engages shoulders (deltoids, traps), back (erector spinae, lats), glutes, quads, and even calves, as the added weight increases demand across the entire body for stabilization against sagging. The main movement pattern is an isometric hold, where muscles contract without changing length, focusing on maintaining a rigid, straight line from head to heels while resisting spinal flexion and rotation. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Core: Transverse Abdominis (deep stabilizer), Rectus Abdominis ("six-pack"), Obliques (sides). 
• Back: Erector Spinae (along the spine), Lats (latissimus dorsi). 
• Shoulders: Deltoids, Traps (trapezius). 
• Chest: Pectorals (minor involvement). 
• Arms: Triceps, Biceps (stabilizing). 
• Lower Body: Glutes (gluteus maximus, medius), Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Calves (all for leg extension and hip stability). [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Movement Pattern 

• Type: Isometric Stabilization. 
• Action: Holding a static, rigid position (like a push-up position on elbows or hands). 
• Resistance: External weight (plate, sandbag) placed on the upper back increases the load, forcing deeper engagement from core and stabilizer muscles to prevent the hips from dropping or the back from arching. 
• Goal: To resist gravity and the added weight, teaching the core to maintain spinal neutral alignment. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11]

## Wheelbarrow Carry
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:WHEELBARROW_CARRY
**search_query:** wheelbarrow carry exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
The Wheelbarrow Carry (pushing) heavily engages the chest (pectorals), shoulders (deltoids), triceps, and core (abdominals) for stability and force, while also working forearms, glutes, and lower back for endurance and balance; it's a compound movement pattern that emphasizes pushing strength, shoulder stability, and anti-extension core control, with significant grip and wrist strength demand as the load increases. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
This video demonstrates how to perform the wheelbarrow carry exercise: 
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Primary Movers (Pushing & Stabilizing): 

    • Pectorals (Chest): Pushing the handles forward and stabilizing the upper body. 
    • Deltoids (Shoulders): Lifting and controlling arm movements. 
    • Triceps: Extending the elbows to push. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Lower Back): Maintaining a straight, stable torso, resisting flexion and lateral movement. 

• Stabilizers & Synergists: 

    • Forearms & Wrists: Grip strength, wrist stability. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Stabilizing the legs and hips. [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Anti-Extension Core Work: Resisting the body's tendency to sink into spinal extension (arching the back). 
• Bilateral Coordination: Both arms work together, requiring coordinated effort. 
• Proprioception: Enhances body awareness and balance. 
• Shoulder Stability: Demands strong shoulder girdle control. 
• Grip & Forearm Endurance: Carrying heavy loads significantly challenges grip strength. 
• Dynamic Stability: Obliques work to prevent side-to-side swaying as you walk. [1, 2, 5, 9, 10]  

Key Takeaway 
It's a full-body challenge that builds pushing power, core strength, and endurance, acting as a functional exercise that strengthens the entire kinetic chain from hands to hips. [5, 9]

## Yoga Flow
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:YOGA_FLOW
**search_query:** yoga sun salutation muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
Yoga flow, particularly Vinyasa, provides a full-body workout by recruiting multiple muscle groups simultaneously in integrated, dynamic movement patterns that are synchronized with breath. It emphasizes functional strength, flexibility, balance, and neuromuscular efficiency. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 
A typical yoga flow engages a wide range of muscles throughout the body. [1, 5]  

| Body Area [4, 6, 7, 8] | Muscles Involved | Poses for Activation  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upper Body | * Shoulders/Back: Trapezius, deltoids, pectoralis major | Downward Dog, Plank, Warrior poses  |
| — | * Arms: Biceps brachii, triceps brachii | Chaturanga (yoga push-up), Plank, Upward Dog, Chair Pose  |
| Core | * Abdominals: External obliques, deep stabilizers | Plank, twists, Cat-Cow, Chair Pose  |
| — | * Back: Erector spinae, mid-back fibers | Upward Dog, "halfway lift," Chair Pose  |
| Lower Body | * Legs/Glutes: Rectus femoris, biceps femoris (hamstrings), glutes, vastus medialis | Chair Pose (squatting), Warrior poses (lunging), Bridge Pose  |
| — | * Ankles/Feet: Tibialis anterior, calves (gastrocnemius) | Standing poses, Downward Dog, various transitions  |

Movement Patterns 
Yoga flow utilizes essential, functional movement patterns that mimic daily life activities. The continuous transitions between poses activate muscles more significantly than holding poses statically. 

• Squatting: Mimicked in poses like Chair Pose (Utkatasana), engaging glutes and quadriceps. 
• Lunging: Seen in Warrior variations and High/Low Lunges, targeting hip flexors, glutes, and adductors while building single-leg stability. 
• Hinging: The hip hinge is central to Forward Folds and "halfway lifts," engaging the posterior chain (hamstrings and back muscles). 
• Pushing and Pulling: The Chaturanga to Upward Dog to Downward Dog sequence (part of the common Sun Salutation flow) involves pushing (triceps, pectorals) and pulling (back muscles) movements that build upper body strength. 
• Rotation and Twisting: Supine Twists and Revolved Triangle engage the core and improve spinal mobility. 
• Gait and Crawling Dynamics: The transition movements within a flow, like stepping back to Plank or walking the feet to the hands, involve elements of crawling and gait patterns, enhancing coordination and core strength. [1, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13]  

By coordinating breath with these varied movements, a yoga flow practice enhances overall body awareness and neuromuscular control. [14, 15]

## Stick Torso Twist
**exercise_id:** CANONICAL:ARNOLD:STICK_TORSO_TWIST
**search_query:** stick torso twist stretch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 
A Stick Torso Twist primarily targets your obliques (internal & external), rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, latissimus dorsi, and erector spinae, focusing on spinal rotation and core stability, working the trunk through a twisting (rotational) movement pattern to improve mobility and strength. The stick helps isolate the twist to the torso, preventing shoulder/arm dominance and ensuring the core initiates the movement, often done with feet together and toes forward for stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary: 

    • Internal & External Obliques: The main muscles responsible for twisting the torso side-to-side. 

• Secondary/Stabilizers: 

    • Rectus Abdominis: The "six-pack" muscles, stabilizing the core. 
    • Transverse Abdominis: Deep core muscles for spinal stability. 
    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Muscles on the sides of your back, assisting in rotation. 
    • Erector Spinae: Muscles running along the spine, stabilizing and assisting. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Help stabilize the lower body, especially when performed with feet together. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Hold a stick across your upper back/shoulders, keeping arms relaxed and shoulder blades engaged. Feet are usually together, toes forward, hips stable. 
2. Rotation: Initiate the twist from your core, rotating your upper body (rib cage and shoulders) to one side, keeping your hips facing forward. 
3. Isolation: The stick keeps your arms and shoulders moving with your torso, forcing the rotation from the spine. 
4. Range: Rotate to a comfortable, pain-free range, looking over the shoulder as you twist. 
5. Return & Repeat: Return to center and twist to the other side. [3, 4, 10, 11, 12]  

Benefits 

• Improves mobility in the thoracic (mid-upper) spine. 
• Strengthens core and obliques. 
• Enhances body awareness and control. 
• Prepares the spine for dynamic movements. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 14]
