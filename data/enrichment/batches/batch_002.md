## Side Plank Bag Slide
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Side_Plank_Bag_Slide
**search_query:** side plank with reach muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Side Plank Bag Slide is an anti-rotation core exercise targeting your obliques, deep core (transverse abdominis), glutes (medius), and shoulder stabilizers, working in a lateral flexion and anti-rotation pattern to build stability by resisting spinal movement while sliding a weight. Key muscles include internal/external obliques, QL, gluteus medius, and lats, challenging unilateral strength and pelvic stability for dynamic movements like running. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Core: External & Internal Obliques (side abs for stabilization & twisting). 
• Deep Core: Transverse Abdominis (stabilizes spine). 
• Hip Stabilizers: Gluteus Medius & Minimus (pelvic stability), Quadratus Lumborum (QL) (low back/pelvic stabilizer). 
• Shoulder/Back: Latissimus Dorsi (lats) & Rotator Cuff (shoulder stabilization). 
• Legs: Gluteus Maximus (hip extension), Quads/Hamstrings (stabilization). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern 

• Isometric Hold: The base side plank provides constant tension to resist gravity and spinal collapse. 
• Anti-Rotation: The sliding motion with the bag challenges your core to prevent your torso from rotating towards the ground. 
• Lateral Flexion: Your obliques and QL work to keep your torso straight and hips lifted. 
• Unilateral Loading: Puts more demand on one side of the body, improving functional strength. [1, 2, 4, 10, 11]  

How it Works 
You're essentially combining the stability of a side plank with a dynamic movement (the slide), forcing the muscles that keep your spine and pelvis stable (obliques, QL, glutes) to work extra hard against the shifting weight, enhancing your body's ability to resist unwanted twisting and movement. [1, 2, 4]

## Overhead Keg Walk
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Overhead_Keg_Walk
**search_query:** overhead carry muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

An Overhead Keg Walk (or similar overhead carry/lunge) works shoulder stability, core bracing, glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, and upper back, combining loaded carry, lunge, and overhead stabilization patterns, focusing on anti-rotation and unilateral strength for overall stability and endurance. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Deltoids (shoulders), Traps, Rhomboids, Lats (upper back), Glutes, Quadriceps, Triceps. 
• Stabilizers: Core (Transverse Abdominis, Obliques), Erector Spinae (lower back), Rotator Cuff, Calves, Hamstrings. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns Engaged 

• Loaded Carry: Holding weight overhead challenges shoulder and trunk stability, preventing collapse. 
• Lunge (Unilateral): Alternating legs builds balance and strength in each leg, targeting quads, glutes, and hamstrings. 
• Overhead Stability/Push: The act of holding the weight overhead engages the entire shoulder girdle and upper back to keep the weight stacked. 
• Core Bracing: Requires deep core engagement (abs and obliques) to prevent the spine from arching or rotating, especially with one leg moving. 
• Glute/Hamstring Engagement: Critical for stability in the standing leg and power during the lunge step. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Key Takeaways 

• Integration: It's a full-body exercise, integrating lower body power (lunge) with upper body stability (overhead hold) and core control. 
• Balance & Coordination: Excellent for improving unilateral strength and coordination, as noted in GarageGymReviews.com (https://www.garagegymreviews.com/fundamental-movement-patterns) and Impulse Chiropractic and Rehab (https://impulsechiropractic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Guide-to-the-7-Functional-Movements.pdf). 
• Stabilization: Particularly useful for strengthening the shoulder joint and core, as explained in Body Glide (https://bodyglide.com/blog/6-essential-functional-movements/) and Hertfordshire Sports Village (https://www.hertssportsvillage.co.uk/news-exercise-of-the-month-waiters-carrywalk-1370).

## Sandbag Suitcase Carry
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Suitcase_Carry
**search_query:** suitcase carry muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Suitcase Carry targets your core (obliques, abdominals, lower back), grip (forearms), shoulders, and hip stabilizers, forcing them to work isometrically to counteract the uneven weight, enhancing balance, posture, and functional strength through anti-lateral flexion. This movement pattern emphasizes unilateral loading, engaging muscles on one side intensely to maintain an upright, stable posture while walking, mimicking real-life lifting and carrying. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Core: Obliques, transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis (bracing isometrically). 
• Grip & Forearms: Intense engagement to hold the bag. 
• Shoulders (Deltoids): Stabilize the weight. 
• Hip Stabilizers: Glutes and hip abductors on the loaded side. 
• Upper Back & Lower Back: To keep the spine neutral. 
• Legs: Quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves work to propel you forward. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

This video demonstrates the muscles worked during a sandbag carry: 
Movement Pattern 

• Anti-Lateral Flexion: The primary pattern, where core muscles contract isometrically to prevent your torso from bending toward the weighted side, says this article from the National Federation of Professional Trainers (https://nfpt.com/suitcase-carries-how-to-do/) and this Facebook post (https://www.facebook.com/justinagustinFB/posts/the-suitcase-carry-exercise-strengthens-the-core-by-loading-one-side-of-the-body/861852099273834/). 
• Unilateral Loading: Weight is on one side, challenging balance and stability more than bilateral carries (like Farmer's Walks). 
• Isometric Core Engagement: Muscles hold tension to resist the weight's pull, building deep core strength and endurance. 
• Dynamic Stability: As you walk, your body constantly adjusts to the shifting load, improving coordination and balance. [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]

## Paused Bench Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Paused_Bench_Press
**search_query:** paused bench press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Paused Bench Press is a compound push movement targeting the Pectoralis Major (chest), Anterior Deltoids (front shoulders), and Triceps, with stabilizers like the serratus anterior, enhancing strength at the bottom by removing momentum, improving muscle recruitment through increased time under tension (TUT), building reversal strength, and fixing weak points off the chest, making it ideal for power development. The key movement pattern involves a controlled descent, a 1-2 second pause at the chest (or an inch above), and an explosive press back up, forcing muscles to work harder from a dead stop. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked (Prime Movers & Synergists) 

• Pectoralis Major (Pecs): Primary chest muscle responsible for horizontal adduction of the shoulder. 
• Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Assist in shoulder flexion and pressing. 
• Triceps Brachii: Extend the elbow, crucial for lockout. 
• Stabilizers: Rotator cuffs, serratus anterior, and upper back muscles (like rhomboids and traps) keep the shoulder blades retracted and stable. [1, 2, 5, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern & Biomechanics 

1. Setup: Lie flat, feet planted, shoulder blades pinched back and down into the bench for tightness. 
2. Descent: Lower the bar slowly and controlled to the mid-chest, keeping elbows at a ~45-degree angle to the torso. 
3. The Pause: Hold the bar motionless on the chest (or slightly above) for 1-2 seconds, engaging isometric strength. 
4. The Press: Explode the bar upward from the dead stop, driving through the chest, shoulders, and triceps. 
5. Lockout: Fully extend the elbows at the top, resetting for the next rep. [1, 2, 3, 4]  

Why the Pause Matters (Benefits) 

• Eliminates Momentum: Forces muscles to initiate the lift from a dead stop, building strength from the bottom. 
• Increases TUT: More time under tension for muscle growth (hypertrophy). 
• Builds Reversal Strength: Develops power to overcome the sticking point just off the chest. 
• Improves Stability & Control: Enhances overall form and prevents form breakdown. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9]

## Thread-the-Needle
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Thread-the-Needle
**search_query:** thread the needle stretch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Thread-the-Needle is a spinal rotation stretch from a tabletop position that targets the upper back (thoracic spine), shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), and latissimus dorsi, improving mobility and releasing tension by mimicking threading an arm under the body, opening the chest, and rotating the spine to improve posture and shoulder/mid-back flexibility. [1, 2, 3]  
This video demonstrates how to perform the Thread the Needle stretch: 
Muscles Worked/Stretched 

• Upper Back: Thoracic Spine (mid-back), Erector Spinae. 
• Shoulders: Deltoids (rear), Rotator Cuff. 
• Back: Latissimus Dorsi (lats). 
• Neck: Upper Trapezius, Levator Scapulae (helps relax these tension-prone muscles). 
• Chest: Pectorals (stretched as the chest opens). 
• Core: Stabilizers engaged to keep hips level (Serratus Anterior, abdominals). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Start: Hands and knees (tabletop position), hands under shoulders, knees under hips, core engaged. 
2. Inhale & Open: Lift one arm (e.g., right) towards the ceiling, rotating the upper back and opening the chest. 
3. Exhale & Thread: Thread that arm under the supporting arm (left), bringing the shoulder and side of the head towards the floor. 
4. Hold/Deepen: Pause in the stretch, feeling the rotation; optionally reach the top arm forward or rotate the palm for a deeper stretch. 
5. Return: Inhale to lift back up, then exhale to return to tabletop. 
6. Repeat: Switch sides. [2, 6, 7, 8]  

Benefits 

• Improves thoracic spine mobility (crucial for posture). 
• Relieves tension in shoulders, neck, and mid-back. 
• Enhances range of motion in the shoulder joint. 
• Connects mind and body for relaxation. [1, 2, 5, 9, 10]

## Quad Extension
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Quad_Extension
**search_query:** leg extension muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The quad extension is a single-joint isolation exercise primarily targeting the Quadriceps Femoris muscle group (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis, Vastus Medialis, Vastus Intermedius) through a knee extension movement, excellent for building thigh mass and definition, especially the "teardrop" (Vastus Medialis) at the top, but also effective for the rectus femoris due to the fixed hip flexion on machines. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked (Primary) 

• Rectus Femoris: The central quad muscle, heavily worked because it crosses both the hip and knee, and the machine keeps the hip flexed. 
• Vastus Lateralis: The outer quad muscle, important for knee extension and stability. 
• Vastus Medialis: The inner "teardrop" muscle, activated most at the top of the movement (full extension) for knee tracking. 
• Vastus Intermedius: The deepest quad muscle, working with the others to extend the knee. [1, 2, 4]  

Movement Pattern 

• Type: Single-joint, open-chain isolation exercise. 
• Action: Knee extension (straightening the leg at the knee) against resistance, with the hip held in a flexed (bent) position. 
• Execution: Sitting on a machine, you lift a weighted pad by extending your lower legs until they are straight, squeezing at the top, then slowly lowering the weight back down. [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Why It's Effective 

• Isolation: Directly targets the quads without significant involvement from hips or back, unlike squats. 
• Definition: Great for building muscle size, improving definition, and enhancing the "teardrop" shape of the vastus medialis. 
• Knee Health: Strengthens muscles crucial for walking, running, jumping, and stabilizing the kneecap (patella). [3, 4, 10, 11]

## Elevated Push-up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Elevated_Push-up
**search_query:** incline push-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

An elevated push-up (incline push-up) works the chest (pectorals), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps as primary movers, while engaging core, serratus anterior, and rotator cuff muscles for stabilization, using a pressing movement pattern (pushing away from an elevated surface) that reduces load but still strengthens these upper body muscles. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Pectoralis Major (Chest): Brings arms toward the body as you lower and pushes them away. 
    • Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Lift the upper arm forward and help press up. 
    • Triceps Brachii (Back of Arms): Straighten the elbow to extend the arms. 

• Stabilizers/Secondary Muscles: 

    • Core (Abs, Obliques): Keeps the body in a straight line, preventing sagging. 
    • Serratus Anterior & Trapezius: Support shoulder blade movement and stability. 
    • Rotator Cuff: Stabilizes the shoulder joint. 
    • Glutes & Quads: Contract to keep hips and legs aligned. [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern (Incline Press) 

1. Starting Position: Hands on an elevated surface (bench, step), body in a straight line from head to heels, core engaged, glutes squeezed. 
2. Descent (Eccentric Phase): Slowly bend elbows, lowering your chest toward the elevated surface, keeping your body tight. 
3. Ascent (Concentric Phase): Press powerfully through your hands, extending your elbows to return to the starting position. 
4. Movement Type: A closed-chain, horizontal pressing movement that's a variation of the standard push-up, making it easier by reducing body weight resistance. [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]

• Core: Abdominals, Obliques (stabilizing the spine and facilitating rotation). 
• Hips: Glutes, Hip Flexors (generating explosive power). 
• Back: Lats, Erector Spinae (transferring force, maintaining posture). 
• Shoulders & Arms: Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms (supporting the lift, stabilizing the bag). 
• Grip: Forearms, Hands (essential for controlling the unstable bag). [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns 

1. Hip Hinge & Squat: Bending at the hips and knees to get under the bag, similar to a deadlift. 
2. Explosive Drive (Triple Extension): Simultaneous extension of the ankles, knees, and hips to powerfully launch the bag. 
3. Core Bracing & Rotation: The midsection braces to transfer power from legs to arms, often involving a rotational element in variations like overhead or rotational throws. 
4. Force Transfer: Efficiently moving energy from the lower body through the core and into the upper body. 
5. Stabilization: Constant muscle engagement (especially core and grip) to control the bag's shifting weight. [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]  

Functional Application 
This movement builds explosive power, full-body coordination, and core strength, making it excellent for athletes in sports requiring powerful throwing, jumping, and lifting actions, and for general functional fitness. [1, 3, 9]

## Ring Pull-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Ring_Pull-Up
**search_query:** ring pull-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Ring pull-ups work major back and arm muscles (lats, biceps, traps, rhomboids) and require significant stabilization from your core (abs, glutes, lower back) and forearms, challenging your grip, due to the unstable nature of the rings, which demands constant adjustment and control through a natural, compound pulling motion that emphasizes scapular stabilization more than bar pull-ups. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main pulling muscle for bringing your chest towards the rings. 
    • Biceps Brachii: Assists in elbow flexion (bending the arm). 
    • Brachialis/Brachioradialis: Deeper arm muscles aiding biceps. 

• Secondary & Stabilizers: 

    • Trapezius (Upper & Lower): Help with scapular movement and stability. 
    • Rhomboids: Retract the shoulder blades. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Stabilizes the scapula. 
    • Forearms & Grip Muscles: Essential for holding the unstable rings. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Lower Back): Prevents swinging and keeps the body rigid. 
    • Glutes & Hip Flexors: Contribute to core stability. [1, 2, 3, 4]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Hang from the rings with an overhand grip (palms facing you or away), body straight, core tight, and arms extended. 
2. Concentric (Pulling Up): Pull your body up by driving your elbows down and back, squeezing your shoulder blades together. The rings will rotate inward (pronate) as you pull. 
3. Peak Contraction: At the top, your chin should be above the rings, chest puffed out, with maximum muscle engagement. 
4. Eccentric (Lowering Down): Control your descent slowly and deliberately, resisting gravity and allowing the rings to rotate back out to the starting position. 
5. Key Feature: The independent movement of the rings forces your stabilizing muscles to work harder than on a fixed bar, promoting natural wrist and shoulder movement. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

## Monster Walk
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Monster_Walk
**search_query:** monster walk exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Monster Walk, performed with a resistance band around the ankles or knees, is a lateral, multi-plane exercise primarily targeting your glutes (medius & minimus), hip abductors, and core, while also engaging quads, hamstrings, and adductors for stability, improving hip/pelvic stability, posture, and functional strength for everyday movements like walking. The movement pattern involves a slight squat with wide, shuffling steps (forward/backward/sideways) in a diagonal or lateral direction, keeping tension on the band to prevent your feet from coming together. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Gluteus Medius & Minimus: Key for hip abduction (moving leg out) and stabilizing the pelvis, preventing knee collapse. 
    • Hip Abductors (Outer Thigh): Work with glutes to control side-to-side motion. 

• Stabilizers & Secondary Muscles: 

    • Gluteus Maximus: Provides power and support. 
    • Quadriceps & Hamstrings: Support the squat position and leg movement. 
    • Adductors (Inner Thigh): Help control the inward pull of the band. 
    • Core Muscles: Maintain upright posture and pelvic stability. [2, 3, 4, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Place a resistance band around your ankles (harder) or just above your knees (easier). Get into a half-squat or "mini-squat" position with your chest up and core engaged. 
2. Step & Shuffle: Take a wide step to the side (e.g., 45-degree angle), keeping tension on the band. 
3. Bring Feet Together (Not Fully): Bring your trailing foot to meet the leading foot, but stop just short of bringing them together to maintain constant tension on the band. 
4. Repeat: Continue stepping in one direction (forward/sideways) and then reverse the pattern to step back, maintaining the squat and band tension. [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]  

Benefits 

• Strengthens often-neglected stabilizing muscles. 
• Improves hip and pelvic stability, reducing lower back and knee pain. 
• Enhances functional movement and athletic performance in multi-directional sports. [2, 4, 8]

## Push-Up to Downward Dog
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Push-Up_to_Downward_Dog
**search_query:** push-up to downward dog muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Push-Up to Downward Dog is a dynamic flow that builds upper body pushing strength (chest, shoulders, triceps) and core stability in the push-up, transitioning into a full-body stretch that lengthens the posterior chain (hamstrings, calves, back) and opens the shoulders/chest, combining strength with mobility and coordinating the diaphragm and deep abdominals for better trunk stability, as noted by Robertson Training Systems (https://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/rts-coaching-push-downward-dog/) and this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlzmTx_l2Bk), improving coordination and revealing core weaknesses like rib flare. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Push-Up Phase (Strength): Pectorals, Deltoids (shoulders), Triceps, Serratus Anterior, Core (abs, obliques), Glutes, Erector Spinae. 
• Downward Dog Phase (Stretch/Stability): Hamstrings, Calves (gastroc/soleus), Shoulders, Upper Back, Glutes, Feet, Chest (opening). 
• Transition (Coordination): Deep core (transverse abdominis), Diaphragm, Rhomboids, Traps (stabilization). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns: 

1. Plank (Start): Body in a straight line, core braced, hips level. 
2. Elbow Bend/Lowering: Hips stay high, body moves as one unit down toward the floor (like a close-grip push-up). 
3. Press Up: Arms extend, pushing the body back up to a plank. 
4. Hinge & Extend (Plank to Downward Dog): From plank, send hips up and back, straightening legs as much as possible to form an inverted 'V' shape, heels driving down. 
5. Stretch/Hold: Hold the inverted 'V', stretching hamstrings and calves while opening the chest and shoulders. 
6. Return: Hips move forward, chest drops between hands, transitioning into a low push-up or upward dog, then back to plank to repeat or finish. [1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11]  

Key Benefits: 

• Full-Body Integration: Connects upper body pushing with lower body stretching and core control. 
• Shoulder Mobility: Opens tight shoulders and improves thoracic spine extension, notes Robertson Training Systems. 
• Core & Breath: Reveals and improves coordination between the diaphragm and deep abdominals, preventing rib flare, say this Medium article and this other article. 
• Posterior Chain Lengthening: Stretches tight hamstrings and calves, beneficial for squat/deadlift mechanics. [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11]

## One-Arm DB Row
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:One-Arm_DB_Row
**search_query:** one arm dumbbell row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The One-Arm Dumbbell Row is a horizontal pulling exercise targeting the Latissimus Dorsi (lats) as the primary mover, supported by the Rhomboids, Traps, and Posterior Deltoids for scapular retraction and shoulder extension, with the Biceps, Forearms (for grip), and Core (for stability) acting as secondary muscles. The movement pattern involves hinging at the hips, keeping your back flat, and pulling the dumbbell towards your hip/abdomen by retracting the shoulder blade and flexing the elbow, emphasizing controlled shoulder extension and adduction. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary: 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main muscle, responsible for pulling the arm down and back (shoulder extension/adduction). 

• Secondary/Synergistic: 

    • Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Pull shoulder blades together (retraction). 
    • Trapezius (Middle & Lower Fibers): Stabilize and retract the scapula. 
    • Posterior Deltoids (Rear Delts): Assist in shoulder extension/horizontal abduction. 
    • Biceps Brachii & Brachialis: Flex the elbow to bring the weight up. 
    • Forearm Muscles (Brachioradialis, etc.): Maintain grip. 
    • Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques): Stabilize the torso and prevent twisting. [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern: 

1. Setup: Place one knee and hand on a bench, keeping your back flat and torso roughly parallel to the floor. 
2. Stretch/Reach: Let the dumbbell hang, allowing your shoulder to stretch forward (shoulder flexion/protraction). 
3. Pull/Concentric: Pull the dumbbell up towards your hip/abdomen by driving your elbow back and squeezing your shoulder blade towards your spine (shoulder extension/adduction, scapular retraction). 
4. Peak Contraction: Squeeze at the top, feeling the back muscles engage. 
5. Lower/Eccentric: Slowly lower the weight back to the starting stretched position with control, resisting the weight. 
6. Key: Avoid torso rotation; focus on pulling with your back muscles, not just your arms. [1, 4, 6, 9]

**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Get-Up
**search_query:** turkish get up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Get-Up (similar to a Turkish Get-Up) is a full-body, multi-planar movement building strength, stability, and endurance, working legs (glutes, hamstrings, quads), core (abs, obliques, lower back), shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), traps, and grip/forearms, using complex patterns like the hinge, lunge, roll, sweep, push, and stand, challenging stabilization and coordination through shifting weight. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Legs: Glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves (driving up). 
• Core: Abdominals, obliques, lower back (significant stabilization). 
• Shoulders: Deltoids, rotator cuff (stabilizing the weight overhead). 
• Back: Traps, erectors (supporting the spine and lifting). 
• Arms/Grip: Biceps, forearms (crushing grip, holding the bag). [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Patterns & Phases 
The get-up progresses through distinct phases, demanding different patterns: 

1. Starting Position (Supine): Lying on your back, holding the bag over one shoulder (or chest), forming a stable base. 
2. Roll to Forearm/Elbow: Rolling onto your forearm/elbow with the lead leg bent and trail leg extended, keeping the core braced and shoulder stable. 
3. Sit-Up Transition: Driving through the elbow and heel, sweeping the back leg under to a high kneel/tall sit. 
4. Hinge/Reposition: Hinging back, placing the free hand down, adjusting the bag to a strong, stable position. 
5. Push to Stand: Driving through the heel, stepping the back leg back into a lunge, then pushing up to a standing split/lunge, then standing tall. 
6. Return: Reversing the steps back to the start, emphasizing control. [2, 4, 10, 11, 12]  

Key Benefits 

• Dynamic Stability: The shifting sand forces greater core and shoulder stabilization than fixed weights. 
• Full-Body Power: Develops strength and coordination across all planes of motion (hinging, squatting, lunging, pushing, pulling).

## Diaphragmatic Breathing
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Diaphragmatic_Breathing
**search_query:** diaphragmatic breathing muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Diaphragmatic breathing primarily uses the diaphragm, the main breathing muscle, which contracts and flattens on inhale (causing abdominal expansion) and relaxes and domes up on exhale (allowing abdominal contraction), coordinating with the pelvic floor and transverse abdominis for core stability, creating a "canister" movement for better oxygenation and core support, unlike shallow chest breathing that overuses upper chest muscles. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Muscle: 

    • Diaphragm: The dome-shaped muscle below the lungs; it contracts and moves down to draw air in (inhale) and relaxes and moves up to push air out (exhale). 

• Core Stabilizers (Working in Coordination): 

    • Pelvic Floor Muscles: Lengthen and relax on inhale, contract gently on exhale to manage pressure. 
    • Transverse Abdominis (Deep Abdominal Muscles): Gently contract inward as you exhale, like a corset, to stabilize the core. 

• Muscles Not Overused (as in shallow breathing): 

    • Upper Trapezius, Scalenes, Pectoralis Minor (accessory muscles in the neck and chest) are less taxed, preventing tension. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns (The Core Canister) 

1. Inhale (Belly Expands): 

    • Diaphragm contracts and descends (flattens). 
    • Creates negative pressure, pulling air into lungs. 
    • Increases intra-abdominal pressure, causing the abdomen to gently expand outward (forward, sideways, backward). 
    • Pelvic floor lengthens and relaxes to accommodate this downward pressure. 

2. Exhale (Belly Contracts): 

    • Diaphragm relaxes and moves upward (domes). 
    • Air passively leaves the lungs. 
    • Abdominal muscles gently contract inward (navel to spine). 
    • Pelvic floor gently contracts and moves upward. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

This creates a coordinated piston-like action from the top (diaphragm) to the bottom (pelvic floor) of your core, providing stability and efficient breathing. [2, 4]

**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Jump_Rope
**search_query:** jump rope muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Jumping rope is a full-body, high-intensity exercise primarily working the calves, quads, hamstrings, and glutes, while also engaging the core, shoulders, forearms, and back for stabilization and rhythm, using fundamental movement patterns like bounding, hopping, and rhythmic rotation for cardio and strength. Key movements involve explosive upward propulsion from the calves and quads, impact absorption by hamstrings and glutes, core bracing for stability, and wrist/shoulder rotation to control the rope. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary (Lower Body): Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus), Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Glutes (gluteus maximus, medius). 
• Secondary (Core & Stabilizers): Abdominals, Back extensors (rhomboids, deltoids). 
• Upper Body (Rhythm & Control): Forearms, Biceps, Triceps, Shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuffs). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns 

1. Bounding/Hopping: The basic up-and-down motion, driven by calf and quad power, with hamstrings and glutes absorbing landing impact. 
2. Rhythmic Rotation: Small, controlled circles made by the wrists and forearms to spin the rope. 
3. Core Engagement: Maintaining an upright posture and stability throughout the movement. 
4. Shoulder Stabilization: Keeping shoulders firm and back to control rope momentum, especially with weighted ropes. 
5. Footwork Variations: Boxer skip (alternating foot taps), side swings, and double unders add complexity and challenge agility and coordination. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Key Benefits 

• Cardiovascular Fitness: Excellent for endurance and calorie burning. 
• Lower Body Strength: Tones and strengthens legs. 
• Bone Density: Improves bone resilience through impact. 
• Coordination & Agility: Enhances footwork and body control. [4, 5, 7, 8, 9]

## Hollow Rock
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Hollow_Rock
**search_query:** hollow rock muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Hollow rocks primarily work your deep core (transverse abdominis), rectus abdominis (six-pack), and obliques for stabilization, with secondary engagement of hip flexors, quads, glutes, and back muscles, all while teaching a dynamic spinal stabilization pattern by rocking between the lower back and shoulder blades, maintaining a rigid, curved body shape. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary (Core): 

    • Rectus Abdominis: The main "six-pack" muscle, controls the rocking motion and maintains the hollow shape. 
    • Transverse Abdominis (TVA): Deepest core muscle, acts like a natural corset to stabilize the spine and pelvis. 
    • Obliques (Internal & External): Prevent torso rotation and add stability. 

• Secondary (Supporting): 

    • Hip Flexors & Quads: Keep legs lifted and stable. 
    • Glutes: Engage to maintain tension in the lower body. 
    • Erector Spinae & Upper Back: Stabilize the spine and support the rounded posture. 
    • Shoulders (Deltoids): Stabilize the arms overhead. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Lie on your back, arms extended overhead, legs straight out, lower back pressed firmly into the floor (posterior pelvic tilt). 
2. The Rock: Engage your core to lift your head, shoulders, and legs slightly off the floor, creating a "hollow" shape. 
3. Dynamic Motion: Gently rock back and forth, shifting weight between your lower back/glutes and your shoulder blades. 
4. Key Principle: The goal is to maintain constant tension in your core, keeping your lower back glued to the floor and preventing it from arching or lifting, controlling the movement through the entire body, not just the abs. [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]  

Benefits 

• Develops midline stability for other lifts (squats, presses). 
• Builds core endurance and body awareness. 
• Foundation for advanced gymnastics and calisthenics. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

## Bear-Hug Step-Over
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Bear-Hug_Step-Over
**search_query:** bear hug carry step over muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Bear-Hug Step-Over, a functional movement, primarily targets your core, glutes, and quads (legs) while improving posture, balance, and upper back mobility by mimicking carrying a heavy object (like with a sandbag or kettlebell) and stepping over an obstacle. It works the pectoralis major, anterior deltoids, and biceps for the "hug" and serratus anterior, rhomboids, and traps for shoulder blade control, enhancing overall full-body strength and coordination. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Legs & Core): 

    • Glutes & Quadriceps (Quads): Essential for lifting the leg over the obstacle and stabilizing the body. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Lower Back): Maintains torso stability and prevents rounding during the carry and step. 

• Supporting & Stabilizing Muscles (Upper Body): 

    • Pectoralis Major & Anterior Deltoids (Chest & Front Shoulders): Engaged to maintain the "hug" position, squeezing the load. 
    • Serratus Anterior, Rhomboids, Trapezius (Upper Back): Work to control and protract the shoulder blades, crucial for wrapping them around the load. 
    • Biceps: Assist in flexing the elbows to hold the object close. 
    • Forearms/Grip: Key for holding the weight (sandbag, kettlebell). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Loaded Carry Pattern: Simulates carrying heavy, awkward objects, building functional strength and improving grip and core endurance. 
• Dynamic Mobility: Improves thoracic (upper back) mobility and scapular (shoulder blade) protraction, helping with posture and breathing. 
• Full-Body Integration: Connects lower body power with upper body stability, training the body to move as one unit. 
• Balance & Coordination: The uneven load and stepping motion challenge balance and coordination, translating to real-life movements. [2, 3, 6, 8]  

How it Works (General Steps) 

1. Load: Secure a weight (sandbag, kettlebell) in a bear hug position (clutched to your chest). 
2. Carry/Walk: Walk with the weight held tight, focusing on bracing your core and squeezing the load. 
3. Step-Over: Step over an imaginary or physical obstacle, lifting your knees high and maintaining the hug. 
4. Repeat: Alternate sides for a continuous, full-body challenge. [3, 4, 5, 6, 10]

## Frog-Leg Crunches
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Frog-Leg_Crunches
**search_query:** frog crunch muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Frog Leg Crunches primarily work your Rectus Abdominis (six-pack abs), engaging the Obliques (side abs) and Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas) as secondary muscles, with the unique leg position activating inner thighs and quads for better lower core focus. The movement pattern involves a spinal flexion (crunch) and hip flexion, bringing knees towards the chest in a "frog" stance, strengthening the core in a functional way by controlling pelvic rotation during the movement, explains ACE Fitness (https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/blog/5201/6-exercise-swaps-for-a-more-effective-workout/). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary: Rectus Abdominis (Upper & Lower Abs) 
• Secondary: Obliques (Side Abs) 
• Synergists: Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas, Rectus Femoris), Quads, Inner Thighs (Adductors) [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern: 

1. Starting Position: Lie on your back with knees bent, feet together, and soles touching (diamond shape), hands supporting your head or by your ears (not pulling). 
2. The Crunch: Exhale as you lift your shoulders and curl your torso off the mat, bringing your knees and elbows closer together. 
3. The Release: Inhale as you slowly lower back down, extending your legs slightly (but not fully) before repeating, maintaining core tension. [1, 2, 3, 8]  

Key Benefits: 

• Targets lower abs more effectively by positioning hips abducted (knees out). 
• Improves functional core strength by working with hip flexors and controlling pelvic movement, notes Julie Lohre (https://julielohre.com/frog-crunch/). [3, 4, 5]

## Log Overhead Lockout
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Log_Overhead_Lockout
**search_query:** log press overhead lockout muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Log Overhead Lockout is an overhead pressing movement pattern and the final static hold of a log lift, involving full elbow and shoulder extension. This position primarily works the triceps and shoulders, with significant engagement of various stabilizing muscles throughout the body. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 
The overhead lockout places an immense demand on both prime movers and stabilizers, especially since the log's neutral grip and awkward shape require more stabilization than a standard barbell. 

• Primary Movers (at lockout): 

    • Triceps Brachii: Crucial for the final elbow extension to lock the weight overhead. 
    • Anterior and Lateral Deltoids: Contract isometrically (and concentrically during the press phase) to hold the load in the overhead position and stabilize the shoulder joint. 

• Synergists and Stabilizers: 

    • Trapezius (Upper, Middle, and Lower): Essential for stabilizing the scapula (shoulder blades) and maintaining an upright posture. 
    • Rotator Cuff Muscles: Deep shoulder muscles that co-contract to center the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) and provide dynamic joint support and stability. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Helps with upward rotation and stabilization of the shoulder blade in the overhead position. 
    • Core Musculature (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis, Erector Spinae): Engage intensely to stabilize the spine, resist hyperextension (excessive arching) of the lower back, and transfer force effectively. 
    • Lats (Latissimus Dorsi): Play a role in creating a solid shelf and providing stability in the overhead position. 
    • Grip/Forearm Flexors: Maintain a strong grip on the log handles. 
    • Glutes: When standing, glute engagement provides a solid foundation and base for stability. [1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]  

Movement Patterns 
The primary movement pattern involved in the final lockout phase is isometric contraction and overhead stabilization. 

• Vertical Pressing: The log lockout is the end phase of a vertical pressing movement (e.g., a push press or strict press). 
• Overhead Stabilization: The core pattern involves holding the heavy load directly above the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, which builds significant functional strength, stability, and endurance. 
• Elbow Extension: The very last part of the upward drive is a powerful elbow extension, where the triceps finish the movement. 
• Scapular Upward Rotation and Fixation: The shoulder blades rotate upward and are then fixed in a stable position by the surrounding muscles to support the weight. [3, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19]

## Plank with Weighted Drag
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Plank_with_Weighted_Drag
**search_query:** plank drag muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Plank with Weighted Drag is a full-body exercise that builds core stability (abs, obliques, lower back), shoulder strength (deltoids, traps), upper back (lats, rhomboids), arms (triceps, biceps), and glutes/legs, challenging anti-rotation and balance while you drag a weight (dumbbell/kettlebell) across your body in a plank position, moving from isometric holds to isotonic pulls. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Core: Transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, obliques (primary stabilizers). 
• Shoulders: Deltoids, trapezius (for stability and pulling). 
• Upper Back: Lats, rhomboids (for pulling action). 
• Arms: Triceps, biceps (assisting the pull). 
• Chest: Pectorals (stabilization). 
• Lower Body: Glutes, hamstrings, quads (for hip stabilization and preventing rotation). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Isometric Core Engagement: The plank itself requires constant core contraction to maintain a straight line. 
• Isotonic Pulling: The act of dragging the weight involves concentric (pulling) and eccentric (lowering) muscle contractions in the pulling arm. 
• Anti-Rotation: Your core and hips resist the urge to rotate as the weight shifts, building anti-rotational strength. 
• Stability & Coordination: Moving under load while staying stable enhances balance and control. 
• Full Body Integration: Combines isometric (static) and isotonic (dynamic) movements for a comprehensive workout. [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]  

How it Works (Movement Pattern) 

1. Start in a high plank with hands under shoulders, feet slightly wider than hip-width, and weight next to one hand. 
2. Reach under your torso with the opposite hand to grab the weight. 
3. Drag the weight across your body to the other side, keeping hips level and core tight. 
4. Place the weight down and repeat with the other arm, alternating sides. [2, 5, 10]

## Pull-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Pull-Up
**search_query:** pull-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The pull-up is a vertical pulling movement primarily targeting the latissimus dorsi (lats), biceps, rhomboids, and traps, with support from deltoids and forearm muscles for grip and stabilization, working to bring the body up towards a bar using shoulder adduction and elbow flexion. Key muscles include the lats (back width), biceps (elbow bending), rhomboids/traps (scapula retraction), and core (stability). [1, 2, 3, 4]  
This video provides a complete overview of the muscles used in a pull-up: 
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Main muscle for pulling the body up (shoulder extension/adduction). 
• Biceps Brachii: Elbow flexion (bending the elbow). 
• Rhomboids & Traps (Middle/Lower): Scapular retraction (pulling shoulder blades together) and depression. 
• Posterior Deltoids (Rear Shoulders): Assist in shoulder extension. 
• Forearms: Grip strength and wrist stabilization. 
• Core (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Trunk stability to prevent swinging. [1, 2, 3, 5]  

Movement Pattern: Vertical Pull 

• Action: Pulling the body upwards against gravity. 
• Grip: Pronated (overhand), palms facing away, emphasizing the lats more than a chin-up. 
• Initiation: Starts from a dead hang, engaging the shoulder blades (scapula) first by pulling them down and back. 
• Execution: Pull chest towards the bar, keeping elbows close, then lower with control. [3, 4, 6, 7]  

This video demonstrates the proper technique for performing a pull-up: 
Key Aspects of the Movement 

• Scapular Engagement: Crucial for power and protecting the shoulder joint, initiating the pull before elbow flexion. 
• Grip Variation: Wide grips target upper lats; narrower grips increase biceps involvement. 
• Full Range of Motion: From a full hang to bringing the chest to the bar for maximum muscle activation. [3, 7, 8]

## Keg Strict Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Keg_Strict_Press
**search_query:** keg press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Keg Strict Press is a full-body compound movement emphasizing shoulder (deltoids) and triceps strength for pressing, while demanding significant core stabilization and grip strength due to the keg's awkward, shifting nature, engaging legs for power and upper back (traps, lats) for stability in a strict, leg-drive-free pattern for lockout strength. It's a powerful full-body lift, building strength and stability beyond just the upper body. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Deltoids (especially anterior), Triceps. 
• Stabilizers/Secondary: Core (abs, obliques), Upper Back (traps, lats), Pecs (upper), Forearms & Grip, Glutes, Legs (for a stable base). [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Keg rests on the shoulder/upper chest in a racked position (after a clean) with a firm grip, feet shoulder-width apart, body braced. 
2. The Press (Concentric): Exhale and press the keg overhead, keeping knees locked and core tight, moving the head back slightly to allow the keg to pass. 
3. Lockout (Top): Achieve full elbow extension overhead with shoulders active, not just arms. 
4. Lowering (Eccentric): Control the keg back down to the starting rack position, maintaining core tension. [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]  

Key Characteristics 

• Strict: No leg drive (unlike a push press or jerk), isolating upper body power and stability. 
• Compound: Engages multiple muscle groups across the entire body. 
• Stability Focus: The shifting weight of the keg heavily taxes core and stabilizing muscles. [1, 2, 4, 6]

## Resistance Band Lateral Walks
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Resistance_Band_Lateral_Walks
**search_query:** banded lateral walks muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Resistance Band Lateral Walks primarily target the hip abductors (Gluteus Medius, Gluteus Minimus, TFL) for hip stabilization, alongside the Gluteus Maximus, strengthening the outer hips, glutes, and core for improved lateral movement, stability, and injury prevention, all while using a side-stepping pattern in a shallow squat. The movement involves leading with the heel, stepping out to the side, then bringing the feet back together, maintaining tension and keeping knees over feet. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
Muscles Worked (Primary Movers) 

• Gluteus Medius & Minimus: Key hip abductors, stabilizing the pelvis and preventing knee collapse (valgus). 
• Gluteus Maximus: Assists with hip extension and outward rotation. 
• Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL): Works with the glutes to abduct the hip. 
• Core: Engaged to maintain stability and prevent torso movement. 
• Quadriceps & Hamstrings: Also engaged to maintain the shallow squat. [1, 3, 6, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern (How it Works) 

1. Starting Position: Band above knees or ankles, feet hip-width apart, in a slight athletic squat (knees bent, hips back). 
2. The Step: Lead with your heel, taking a controlled step to the side (e.g., right) while keeping tension on the band. 
3. Bring Feet Together: Bring the trailing foot (left) to meet the leading foot, returning to hip-width apart, but never letting feet get too close. 
4. Maintain Tension: Ensure knees stay in line with feet, preventing them from caving inward. 
5. Repeat: Continue stepping in one direction, then switch, focusing on small, controlled steps. [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10]  

Benefits & Why It's Done 

• Activates & Strengthens Glutes: Excellent for activating the gluteus medius, crucial for hip health. 
• Improves Hip Stability: Enhances lateral stability, vital for sports and daily function. 
• Corrects Movement Patterns: Prevents knees from caving in (valgus), reducing injury risk (like ACL). 
• Warm-up/Activation: Ideal for activating glutes before squats or deadlifts. [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

## Wood Splitting
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Wood_Splitting
**search_query:** chopping wood muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Wood splitting is a full-body, functional movement that primarily involves a rotational, high-to-low diagonal movement pattern (transverse plane). It engages a wide array of muscles, from the lower body to the core and upper body, and is considered an effective workout for building functional strength and power. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Movement Patterns 
The primary movement pattern in wood splitting is a dynamic, high-to-low diagonal motion, often referred to as a "wood chop" in fitness contexts. Key patterns include: 

• Rotational Power: The core of the movement involves twisting the torso and hips to generate force. This builds rotational strength and power, crucial for many sports and daily activities involving twisting and lifting. 
• Hinge and Squat: The motion often starts from an athletic stance with feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent, incorporating elements of a hip hinge and squat to generate power from the lower body. 
• Overhead Lifting/Swinging: The axe is raised overhead before the downward swing, engaging the shoulders and upper back. 
• Stabilization: The entire body, especially the core and lower body, works intensely to stabilize the movement and control the momentum of the axe. [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Muscles Worked 
When performed with proper form, wood splitting engages virtually every major muscle group in the body: [10, 11]  

| Body Area [5, 8, 9, 10] | Primary Muscles Worked  |
| --- | --- |
| Core | Obliques (internal and external), transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, and erector spinae (spinal stabilizers).  |
| Upper Body | Deltoids and rotator cuff muscles (shoulders), latissimus dorsi, traps, and rhomboids (back), biceps, triceps, and forearm/grip muscles.  |
| Lower Body | Gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus (hips/glutes), quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves.  |

This comprehensive engagement makes wood splitting a highly efficient, full-body exercise that can improve core stability, balance, coordination, and overall muscular endurance. [9, 12]

## Rock-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Rock-Up
**search_query:** rock up exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The "rock-up" movement is an explosive vertical pull transitioning into a vertical/horizontal push movement pattern, commonly known as a muscle-up. This bodyweight exercise is a complex, compound movement that works numerous muscles across the entire body. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 
The rock-up (muscle-up) primarily engages the following muscle groups: [5]  
Primary Movers • Back: The latissimus dorsi (lats) are the main pulling muscles, essential for the initial explosive pull upward. 
• Arms: 

    • Biceps brachii are heavily involved in the pulling phase. 
    • Triceps brachii are the primary movers during the "up" (dipping/pushing) phase to lock out the arms over the bar. 
    • Forearms and hand intrinsic muscles are constantly engaged to maintain a strong grip. 

• Shoulders: The deltoids (front, middle, and rear) are crucial for stability and moving the arms throughout the range of motion. 
• Chest: The pectoralis major assists in the transition and pushing phase. 
• Core: The rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis stabilize the spine and transfer force between the upper and lower body, especially during the dynamic transition. [1, 3, 4]  

Stabilizer Muscles • Upper Back: The trapezius and rhomboids stabilize the scapula (shoulder blades) throughout the entire movement. 
• Serratus Anterior: Important for scapular stability and upward rotation during the reach and push phases. [1, 3, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns 
The rock-up combines two fundamental movement patterns: 

• Vertical Pulling: The initial phase involves pulling the body up toward the bar, similar to a pull-up. 
• Vertical Pushing: The second phase involves pushing the body up and over the bar, finishing in a straight-arm support position, similar to a straight-bar dip. [3, 4]  

The full movement is a dynamic, explosive action that requires significant coordination, strength, and power to smoothly transition from the pull to the push. [3]

## Seated Curl-Bar Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Seated_Curl-Bar_Press
**search_query:** seated shoulder press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

A Seated Curl-Bar Press (often called a Seated EZ-Bar Curl to Press) primarily targets the Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, and Forearms, with secondary involvement from Anterior Deltoids, combining elbow flexion (curling) with shoulder flexion/pressing. The movement pattern involves curling the bar up (like a standard bicep curl) and then continuing the upward motion to press it overhead, engaging shoulders at the top before slowly reversing the motion back down. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary Movers (Biceps & Forearms): 

    • Biceps Brachii: The main muscle on the front of your upper arm, responsible for flexing the elbow. 
    • Brachialis: A deeper elbow flexor that pushes the biceps up, adding arm size. 
    • Brachioradialis: A forearm muscle that assists with elbow flexion, especially in the lower part of the curl. 

• Secondary/Stabilizers: 

    • Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Engaged as the movement transitions from a curl to an overhead press. 
    • Core/Glutes: Braced to stabilize the torso and prevent swinging. [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

This video demonstrates the proper form for a seated curl-bar press: 
Movement Pattern: 

1. Starting Position: Sit on a bench, feet flat, holding the EZ-bar with an underhand grip (palms up or angled). 
2. The Curl Phase: Flex at the elbows, bringing the bar up towards your chest/nipple line, squeezing the biceps. 
3. The Press Phase (Transition): Continue the motion, pressing the bar overhead until your arms are extended. 
4. The Descent (Reverse): Control the weight as you lower it back to shoulder height (reverse of the press) and then continue lowering to the starting curl position, maintaining tension. 
5. Controlled Repetition: Perform in a smooth, controlled manner, avoiding momentum and focusing on the eccentric (lowering) phase for better muscle engagement. [2, 5, 6]  

You can also watch this video to learn how to perform the standard seated barbell curl: 
Key Considerations: 

• Grip: The EZ-bar's angles reduce wrist and elbow strain compared to a straight bar. 
• Focus: It combines bicep isolation with shoulder engagement, making it efficient but requiring control to avoid using momentum. 
• Weight: Start light to master the combined movement before increasing load. [1, 2, 10]

## Weighted Push-Ups
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Weighted_Push-Ups
**search_query:** weighted push-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Weighted push-ups are a compound movement primarily targeting the chest (pectoralis major), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps, while also heavily engaging core stabilizers (abs, obliques, erector spinae), serratus anterior, glutes, and back muscles for stability and full-body tension, using a pushing motion (concentric) and lowering (eccentric) to build upper body pushing strength. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pushing): 

    • Pectoralis Major (Chest): Main muscle for pushing the body up. 
    • Triceps Brachii (Back of Arms): Extends the elbow to push up. 
    • Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Assist in lifting the arm forward and stabilizing the shoulder. 

• Stabilizers & Secondary Muscles (Throughout the movement): 

    • Serratus Anterior: Moves and stabilizes the shoulder blade (scapula). 
    • Core (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis): Keeps the torso rigid and prevents sagging. 
    • Glutes & Lower Back (Erector Spinae): Maintain a straight line and prevent hip sagging. 
    • Latissimus Dorsi & Trapezius (Back): Help with shoulder stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern (Concentric & Eccentric) 

1. Starting Position (Plank): Body in a straight line from head to heels, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, core braced, glutes tight, weight distributed evenly. 
2. Eccentric Phase (Lowering): Slowly bend elbows, lowering your chest towards the floor, keeping your body straight and shoulder blades stable. 
3. Concentric Phase (Pushing): Press powerfully through your hands to extend your elbows, returning to the starting plank position, focusing on driving through the chest, shoulders, and triceps. 
4. Key Technique: Maintain a tight core and glutes throughout to prevent your lower back from arching or hips from dropping, ensuring the movement is a full-body effort. [1, 3, 4, 8, 9]

## Wall Slides
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Wall_Slides
**search_query:** wall slides exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Wall Slides are an excellent mobility drill targeting the upper back (traps, rhomboids), shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), and serratus anterior, improving scapular stability, overhead reach, and posture by promoting upward shoulder rotation and decompressing the shoulder joint while engaging the core for stability. The movement pattern involves pressing forearms/hands against a wall and sliding them overhead, emphasizing controlled, slow motion to improve the shoulder's overhead movement and activate stabilizing muscles. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Upper Back: Trapezius (especially lower traps), Rhomboids (stabilize shoulder blades). 
• Shoulders: Deltoids, Rotator Cuff Muscles (for stability). 
• Serratus Anterior: Crucial for upward scapular rotation. 
• Core: Abdominals, Erector Spinae (maintain posture and prevent arching). [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Stand with your back, head, shoulders, and forearms/hands against a wall, elbows bent at 90 degrees (like a goalpost). 
2. The Slide: Slowly slide your arms overhead, trying to keep all points (back, forearms, hands) touching the wall, reaching as high as comfortable. 
3. Scapular Action: Focus on upwardly rotating the shoulder blades and depressing the humerus (bone in the upper arm). 
4. Controlled Return: Slowly lower arms back to the starting position, maintaining control and avoiding shrugging the shoulders. [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]  

Key Focuses & Benefits 

• Improved Posture: Counteracts rounded shoulders by strengthening mid/upper back. 
• Enhanced Mobility: Increases range of motion for overhead activities. 
• Scapular Control: Teaches proper scapular movement (upward rotation). 
• Injury Prevention: Reduces strain by improving shoulder mechanics. [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]

## V-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:V-Up
**search_query:** v-up exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The V-Up is a full-body core exercise primarily targeting the rectus abdominis, obliques, and hip flexors, while also engaging legs (hamstrings, quads, glutes) and shoulders for stabilization, requiring simultaneous lifting of the torso and legs into a 'V' shape from a flat starting position, demanding significant core strength and coordination for controlled movement. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary: Rectus Abdominis (the "six-pack" muscles). 
• Secondary: Obliques, Transverse Abdominis (deeper core), Hip Flexors (iliopsoas, rectus femoris). 
• Stabilizers: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Shoulders (Deltoids), Upper Back (Erector Spinae). [3, 4]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Lie flat on your back, arms extended overhead, legs straight, forming a line with your body. 
2. Concentric (Lifting) Phase: Exhale as you simultaneously lift your legs and torso off the floor, keeping your legs relatively straight, crunching your abs to bring your hands towards your feet (or shins) to form a 'V' shape. 
3. Peak Contraction: Squeeze your abs at the top, keeping your back straight to avoid arching. 
4. Eccentric (Lowering) Phase: Inhale as you slowly and controlled lower your torso and legs back to the starting position, maintaining core tension. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Key Technique Points 

• Coordination: This is a full-body movement requiring simultaneous lift. 
• Control: Avoid using momentum; focus on slow, controlled movements to maximize core engagement. 
• Breathing: Exhale on exertion (lifting), inhale on return (lowering). 
• Progression: Start with variations like reverse crunches or bent-knee leg raises to build strength before attempting full V-ups. [5, 6, 7, 8]

## Two-Handed Pehl Row
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Two-Handed_Pehl_Row
**search_query:** seal row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Two-Handed Pehl (Pendlay) Row is a powerful horizontal pulling movement targeting the lats, rhomboids, traps, rear delts, and biceps, strengthening the entire upper back for posture, while the lower back, core, glutes, and forearms act as stabilizers, emphasizing explosive strength and power through a full range of motion from a dead stop on the floor. [1, 2, 3]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pulling): 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Main back muscle for pulling the weight towards the torso. 
    • Rhomboids & Traps (Trapezius): Squeeze shoulder blades together, retracting the upper back. 
    • Posterior Deltoids (Rear Delts): Assist in pulling the weight, especially with slightly flared elbows. 
    • Biceps & Brachialis: Flex the elbow to bring the bar towards the body. 

• Stabilizers (Isometric Contraction): 

    • Spinal Erectors: Maintain a neutral, stable spine. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques): Keep the torso rigid. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Help stabilize the hips and lower body. 
    • Forearms & Grip Muscles: Hold onto the barbell. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position (Dead Stop): From a hip-hinged, torso-parallel position (or slightly angled), the barbell rests on the floor. 
2. Concentric (Pulling Phase): explosively pull the barbell from the floor to the lower chest/upper abdomen by driving the elbows back and squeezing the shoulder blades. 
3. Eccentric (Lowering Phase): Slowly and with control, lower the barbell back to a dead stop on the floor. 
4. Horizontal Pull: It's a horizontal pull because the weight moves towards the torso, not overhead. 
5. Power & Full Range: The dead stop and floor-to-chest movement build explosive power and strength throughout the entire pulling range, preventing momentum-based cheating. [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]

## Front-Rack Walking Lunge
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Front_Rack_Walking_Lunge
**search_query:** front rack lunge muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Front-Rack Walking Lunge heavily targets your quads, glutes, and hamstrings, with significant engagement from your core (abs, lower back) for stability, plus activation in your calves and hip flexors, working through a fundamental bilateral unilateral pattern (one leg at a time) that improves balance, coordination, and functional strength. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Quadriceps: Extend the knee and control the descent. 
    • Glutes (Gluteus Maximus, Medius): Extend the hip and provide stability. 
    • Hamstrings: Work with glutes to extend the hip and flex the knee. 

• Stabilizers/Secondary Muscles: 

    • Core (Abs & Lower Back): Crucial for maintaining an upright torso and balance with the weight in front. 
    • Calves: Assist with ankle stability and propulsion. 
    • Hip Flexors: Help lift the leg forward. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern: 

• Bilateral/Unilateral: You perform the lunge on one leg (unilateral) before switching, but the weight is held with both hands (bilateral), challenging balance. 
• Sagittal Plane: The primary motion is forward and backward (stepping forward, returning), though you need lateral stability. 
• Eccentric & Concentric: Muscles lengthen (eccentric) controlling the lowering phase and shorten (concentric) pushing back up. 
• Functional Strength: It mimics natural walking, improving real-world movement and coordination. [3, 6, 8, 9, 10]  

How it Works: 
Holding the weight in the front rack position (across the shoulders) forces your core to work harder to keep your spine neutral, while the walking motion builds endurance and coordination in your legs. [1, 2, 5]

## Gladiator Dumbbell Deadlifts
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Gladiator_Dumbbell_Deadlifts
**search_query:** single leg dumbbell deadlift muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Gladiator Dumbbell Deadlift is a rotational hip-hinge movement that builds posterior chain strength (glutes, hamstrings, back) and core stability, unlike standard deadlifts; it involves picking up one dumbbell with one hand while the other stays close to the back, creating anti-rotation and integrating hip extension with spinal stabilization, targeting forgotten muscles like the QL (quadratus lumborum) and deep core stabilizers for enhanced functional strength and injury resilience. [1, 2, 3]  
This video demonstrates the form for the Gladiator Dumbbell Deadlift: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Posterior Chain): Glutes, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae (lower back). 
• Stabilizers/Secondary Muscles: Obliques, Quadratus Lumborum (QL), Transverse Abdominis, Lats, Traps, Grip. 
• Legs: Quads (involved in knee extension during the lift). [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Stand between two dumbbells, feet hip-width apart. 
2. Initiation: Reach across with one hand to grab the dumbbell on the opposite side, keeping the other dumbbell close to your back/pocket. 
3. The Hinge: Hinge at your hips (pushing them back) with a slight bend in the knees, maintaining a flat back. 
4. The Lift: Drive through your hips and squeeze your glutes to return to standing, keeping the dumbbell close to your body. 
5. Controlled Descent: Lower the weight slowly, focusing on the hip hinge and feeling the stretch in your hamstrings. 
6. Key Difference: Unlike a traditional deadlift, this is a rotational hinge, emphasizing anti-rotation and core control throughout the movement. [1, 2, 3, 8]  

You can see the rotational aspect of the movement in this video:

**search_query:** trap bar row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Trap-Bar Row is a compound back exercise targeting the lats, rhomboids, traps (mid-back) for thickness and width, while also engaging rear delts, biceps, forearms, and the core for stability, making it great for overall upper back strength and grip. The movement pattern is a hip hinge with powerful elbow drive, focusing on pulling the bar towards the belly button while maintaining a flat back, challenging the posterior chain (glutes/hamstrings) isometrically. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
This video demonstrates the muscle engagement during the trap bar row: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Back): Latissimus Dorsi (lats), Rhomboids, Trapezius (mid/lower). 
• Secondary Movers (Pulling/Stabilizers): Rear Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms, Erector Spinae (lower back), Glutes/Hamstrings (isometric hold), Core (obliques, abs). [2, 3, 4]  

You can see a visual breakdown of the muscles worked in this video: 
Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand inside the trap bar with feet hip-width apart, knees soft, hinging at the hips with a flat back (like a deadlift start). 
2. Grip: Grab the handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). 
3. Pull (Concentric): Drive your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull the bar towards your midsection. 
4. Hold: Briefly squeeze your back muscles at the top. 
5. Lower (Eccentric): Control the weight back down, extending your hips and maintaining a flat back, inhaling as you lower. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

This video shows the step-by-step technique for performing the trap bar row: 
Key Technique Points 

• Flat Back: Essential to protect your lower back and effectively target the upper back. 
• Elbow Drive: Focus on pulling your elbows back, not just your hands. 
• Glute/Hamstring Engagement: Keep your posterior chain tight to support your torso. 
• Core Bracing: Engage your core to maintain spinal stability. [1, 4]

## Hip Circles
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Hip_Circles
**search_query:** hip circles muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Hip circles primarily target your hip flexors, glutes, abductors, adductors, and core, working through hip flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction (moving the leg in, out, forward, and back) to lubricate the hip socket, improve range of motion, and build stability for better balance and reduced lower back pain. The movement pattern involves rotating the thigh bone in the hip socket, either standing or on hands and knees, to enhance control and joint health. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Gluteus Medius/Minimus (side hip), Gluteus Maximus (extension), Hip Flexors (lifting leg forward). 
• Stabilizers/Assisters: Core (abs, obliques), Lower Back muscles, Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL), Adductors (inner thighs), Sartorius, Rectus Femoris. [1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Dynamic Movement: It's a circular motion (like drawing a bowl or circle with your knee) that integrates multiple planes of motion (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction). 
• Joint Lubrication: Distributes synovial fluid, reducing stiffness, common in desk-bound individuals, notes this blog post from dianarangaves.com (https://dianarangaves.com/2025/10/04/hip-circles/), this article from Pliability (https://pliability.com/stories/why-is-hip-mobility-important), and this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT-EUIz9idQ). 
• Improved Mobility & Stability: Strengthens muscles controlling the hip socket, improving control, balance, and posture. 
• Reduced Pain: Helps alleviate tightness and pain in hips and lower back by addressing compromised ranges of motion, says this Facebook video from TheMSGym, this TikTok video (https://www.tiktok.com/@megan.dahlman/video/7530384613903060238), and this article from Healthline (https://www.healthline.com/health/hip-exercises). [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 12]  

How to Perform (Hands & Knees Example) 

1. Start on hands and knees (tabletop position). 
2. Lift one knee, keeping it bent, and move it out to the side (abduction). 
3. Continue the circle back and around, bringing the thigh towards your chest (flexion). 
4. Finish the circle by bringing the foot back to the starting position. 
5. Reverse the direction for equal reps, focusing on control and avoiding low back arching. [2, 3, 5, 7]

## Trap Bar Deadlift RDL Combo
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Trap_Bar_Deadlift_RDL_Combo
**search_query:** deadlift rdl combo muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

A Trap Bar Deadlift (TBD) + Romanian Deadlift (RDL) combo targets the entire posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lower back) plus quads, core, and upper back, blending the TBD's more upright, quad-friendly hinge with the RDL's deeper hamstring focus, creating a powerful hip hinge movement that builds overall strength, especially when transitioning between the two variations or performing them sequentially for hypertrophy and strength. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Posterior Chain): Glutes, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae (Lower Back). 
• Secondary Movers (Lower Body): Quadriceps (more in TBD), Calves, Adductors. 
• Stabilizers (Core & Upper Body): Core (Abs, Obliques), Traps, Lats, Forearms (Grip). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns 

• Trap Bar Deadlift (TBD): A hybrid hip hinge and squat pattern, allowing for a more upright torso and greater knee bend than traditional deadlifts, increasing quad involvement. 
• Romanian Deadlift (RDL): A pure hip hinge, focusing on driving the hips back with minimal knee bend, creating a deep stretch in the hamstrings and emphasizing the posterior chain. 
• The Combo: You'll move from the TBD's upright start to a deeper hip hinge, mimicking the RDL's eccentric (lowering) phase, feeling the stretch in the hamstrings before driving the hips forward to stand tall. [2, 3, 4, 7]  

This video demonstrates the movement patterns of the Trap Bar Deadlift and the Romanian Deadlift: 
How the Combo Works 

1. Start with a TBD: Begin in the center of the bar, feet hip-width, handles grasped. 
2. Transition to RDL: Instead of a full squat, sit your hips back (like an RDL) to lower the bar, feeling the hamstring stretch. 
3. Drive Up: Explode up by driving hips forward and squeezing glutes, returning to the TBD's standing position. 
4. Lower with Control: Slowly lower the bar back down, focusing on the hip hinge and hamstring stretch to complete the rep. [1, 2, 7, 8]  

This blend builds strength through both the quads (TBD) and hamstrings/glutes (RDL) in a single, powerful movement, enhancing functional strength and muscle development. [1, 3, 9]

## Hip Swing
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Hip_Swing
**search_query:** hip swing exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

A hip swing, often referring to dynamic leg swings or the fundamental hip hinge, primarily targets the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lower back) for strength and the hip flexors and abdominals for dynamic mobility, using a pattern of hip flexion (bringing thigh to torso) and extension (driving thigh back) while stabilizing the core for control, crucial for power and preventing spinal strain in daily life. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Posterior Chain): 

    • Glutes (Gluteus Maximus): Extend the hip to drive the leg forward/upward and back. 
    • Hamstrings: Assist glutes in hip extension and stabilize the knee. 

• Stabilizers & Synergists: 

    • Erector Spinae: Support and maintain a neutral, stable spine, especially in hip hinges. 
    • Core (Transverse Abdominis): Deep abdominal muscles that brace the pelvis and spine for stability. 
    • Hip Flexors (Iliacus, Psoas): Engage to lift the thigh towards the torso (hip flexion) during the forward swing. 
    • Quadriceps: Help stabilize the knee joint during movement. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

1. The Hip Hinge (Foundation): Involves bending at the hips, not the waist, with a neutral spine, pushing your hips backward as if closing a car door with your butt. 
2. Dynamic Swing (Leg Swings): A controlled, repetitive motion where the leg swings forward (hip flexion) and backward (hip extension). 
3. Core Engagement: The abs and spinal erectors work isometrically (without changing length) to keep the torso upright and prevent the lower back from rounding or hyperextending. 
4. Balance & Control: You're moving the femur (thigh bone) within the hip socket, emphasizing glute and hamstring power on the extension and hip flexor control on the flexion. [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9]  

Key Benefits 

• Strength: Develops the posterior chain, vital for lifting and explosive movements. 
• Mobility: Improves hip flexibility and range of motion. 
• Injury Prevention: Teaches you to move from your hips, protecting your lower back. [1, 4, 7, 10, 11]

## Hollow Hold
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Hollow_Hold
**search_query:** hollow hold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Hollow Hold is a full-body isometric exercise, primarily working your core (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques) to stabilize the spine by preventing arching, while also engaging hip flexors, quads, lower back muscles (erector spinae, quadratus lumborum), shoulders (deltoids, pecs), and neck muscles to maintain the static, "hollow" shape against gravity, teaching core tension and spinal bracing for other movements. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Core (Primary): Rectus Abdominis, Transverse Abdominis, Obliques. 
• Legs: Quadriceps, Hip Flexors (to keep legs lifted and straight). 
• Back: Erector Spinae, Quadratus Lumborum (to press lower back down). 
• Shoulders/Chest: Deltoids, Pectorals (to keep arms overhead). 
• Neck: Muscles stabilizing the head. [1, 2, 3, 4]  

Movement Pattern 

• Type: Isometric Anti-Extension. 
• Action: Your core muscles contract to resist extension (arching) of the lower back, creating a rigid, braced posture. 
• Goal: To maintain a "hollow" shape where the lower back is pressed flat to the floor, ribs down, with limbs extended away from the body, challenging your entire anterior chain. [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

How it Works 
You hold a static position, preventing movement, forcing deep core muscles to work hard to keep your spine stable and protect it from gravity's pull, building essential bracing skills for exercises like squats, deadlifts, and handstands. [2, 5, 6, 8]

• Core & Posture: Abdominals, Obliques, Lower Back (erector spinae), Upper Back (traps, rhomboids). 
• Upper Body (Stabilizers/Grip): Biceps, Forearms, Shoulders (deltoids), Lats (for holding the weight). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand over the weight (sandbag/ball), hinge at the hips, and scoop your hands underneath to hug it to your chest. 
2. Descent: Initiate the squat by pushing hips back, keeping your chest up and core braced, as if tearing a newspaper with your feet (external rotation) to engage glutes and maintain tension. 
3. Bottom: Reach the deepest comfortable depth with an upright torso, ensuring your back maintains its natural curve. 
4. Ascent: Drive through your feet, extending hips and knees powerfully to return to standing, keeping the weight pressed firmly to your chest. [4, 6, 11, 12]  

Key Benefits 

• Improves Posture: Forces an upright torso, strengthening postural muscles. 
• Builds Functional Strength: Mimics real-world lifting and carrying. 
• Enhances Core Stability: Unstable weight (like a sandbag) constantly challenges core stabilizers. 
• Develops Grip: Holding the object firmly builds grip strength. [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

## Standing Forward Fold
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Standing_Forward_Fold
**search_query:** standing forward fold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana) primarily stretches the entire back of the body, heavily engaging the hamstrings, calves, glutes, and spinal erectors, while activating the core and quadriceps for support, with the movement pattern being a hip hinge (forward flexion at the hips) to lengthen the posterior chain from feet to head, controlling the descent with eccentric hamstring contraction. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Stretch (Lengthened): 

    • Hamstrings: Back of the thighs. 
    • Calves: Gastrocnemius and soleus. 
    • Glutes: Gluteus maximus, medius, minimus (buttocks). 
    • Spinal Muscles: Erector spinae, multifidus, quadratus lumborum (lower back). 
    • Adductors: Inner thighs (especially adductor magnus). 
    • Neck & Shoulders: Back of the neck and shoulders (ligaments & tissues). 

• Active Engagement (Supporting/Stabilizing): 

    • Core: Abdominals, pelvic floor (to support the spine). 
    • Quadriceps: Muscles at the front of the thighs (to keep knees slightly lifted/engaged). [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Hip Hinge: The movement initiates from the hips, not the lower back, by tilting the pelvis forward. 
2. Spinal Lengthening: The spine elongates, creating space along the entire back body. 
3. Controlled Descent: Hamstrings work eccentrically (lengthening while controlling) to lower the torso. 
4. Core Engagement: Abdominals pull in to support the lower back as you fold. 
5. Deepening the Fold: The head releases down, increasing the stretch through the neck and posterior chain. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
