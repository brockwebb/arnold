## Sandbag Shouldering
**exercise_id:** EXERCISE:SANDBAG_SHOULDERING
**search_query:** sandbag shouldering muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 2026-01-07

Sandbag Shouldering is a full-body, functional movement targeting legs (glutes, hamstrings), hips, core (abs, lower back, obliques), shoulders, traps, and arms (biceps/forearms) by lifting a shifting load from the ground to the shoulder, emphasizing explosive hip power, core stability, and grip strength through a dynamic hip hinge and upward drive, mimicking real-world lifting. The pattern involves a deadlift-like pull, transitioning to a powerful hip extension (like a front squat/leg press), and finishing with a shoulder stabilization, building total-body coordination.

Muscles Worked
* Legs: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps (especially during the drive up).
* Hips & Core: Hip extensors, Abdominals, Obliques, Lower Back (erector spinae) for stability.
* Back: Upper Back (traps, rhomboids) for stabilization and pulling.
* Shoulders & Arms: Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms (grip).

Movement Pattern (Ground-to-Shoulder)
1. Setup: Stand over the sandbag with feet shoulder-width apart, hips hinged back, chest up, and a firm grip on the bag.
2. First Pull (Deadlift): Pull the bag into your lap, keeping your back straight, similar to a deadlift, focusing on hip hinge.
3. Second Pull (Explosion): From the lap, explode upwards by driving your hips forward and extending your legs (like a front squat/leg press).
4. Shoulder Transfer: As you drive up, use your hips and torso to launch the bag upward, catching it on your shoulder, stabilizing with the opposite hand.
5. Stabilization: Brace your core and hold the bag securely on the shoulder.

Key Concepts
* Full-Body Integration: It's not just arms or legs; the whole body works together.
* Hip Hinge Foundation: Strong hip hinge mobility and strength are crucial for getting the bag to the lap.
* Unstable Load: The shifting weight constantly challenges core stabilizers (abs, obliques, lower back).
* Power Development: Builds explosive power through the hips and posterior chain.
* Functional Strength: Mimics real-world lifting and carrying.

## Kettlebell Swings
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Kettlebell_Swings
**search_query:** kettlebell swings muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Kettlebell swings are a ballistic hip-hinge movement that powerfully targets the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lower back) for explosive power, while also engaging the core (abdominals, obliques, erectors) for stabilization and the upper back, shoulders, and forearms for control, making it a full-body exercise for strength, power, and conditioning. The primary action is an explosive hip thrust, not a squat, driving the bell upward, with the arms merely guiding it. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Primary Muscles Worked (Posterior Chain) 

• Glutes (Gluteus Maximus): The main driver, responsible for explosive hip extension. 
• Hamstrings: Assist with hip extension and stabilize the knees. 
• Erector Spinae (Lower Back): Work isometrically to keep the spine neutral and stable. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Secondary & Stabilizing Muscles 

• Core (Transverse Abdominis, Obliques, Rectus Abdominis): Brace and stabilize the spine and pelvis. 
• Lats & Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids, Posterior Deltoids): Control the kettlebell's path and maintain posture. 
• Shoulders (Anterior Deltoids, Rotator Cuffs): Control the kettlebell's arc. 
• Forearms & Grip Muscles: Maintain a strong grip. 
• Quadriceps: Assist with knee extension, especially at the bottom. 
• Adductors: Aid in hip extension. [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern: The Hip Hinge 

1. Hinge, Don't Squat: The movement starts by pushing the hips back (hinging) with a soft bend in the knees, keeping your chest up and back flat, not by squatting down. 
2. Explosive Hip Drive: Power comes from powerfully extending the hips forward (like thrusting your hips into a wall), not pulling with the arms. 
3. Arm Control: Your arms are essentially ropes; they don't pull the bell up; the hip drive propels it. 
4. Dynamic Stability: Your core and back muscles work hard to keep your spine rigid as the bell swings forward and then back through your legs. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10]  

Types of Swings 

• Russian Swing: Kettlebell travels to eye or shoulder height. 
• American Swing: Kettlebell travels overhead, requiring more shoulder mobility and range of motion. [11, 12, 13]

## Renegade Row
**exercise_id:** EXERCISE:RENEGADE_ROW
**search_query:** renegade row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Renegade Row is a full-body strength exercise that primarily targets the back (lats, rhomboids, traps) and core (obliques, abs) for stability, while also engaging shoulders (deltoids), arms (biceps, triceps), glutes, and even hamstrings to resist rotation and maintain a plank, making it excellent for core strength, balance, and upper body pulling power. Its movement pattern combines a plank hold with a single-arm dumbbell row, demanding anti-rotational stability as you alternate pulling the weight towards your hip. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pulling): 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Main back muscle for pulling. 
    • Rhomboids & Traps: Stabilize shoulder blades and assist the lats. 
    • Biceps: Assist with the pulling motion. 

• Stabilizers (Plank & Anti-Rotation): 

    • Core (Obliques, Transverse Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis): Crucial for preventing torso rotation. 
    • Shoulders (Deltoids): Stabilize the shoulder joint. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Help keep the hips stable and prevent lower back arching. 
    • Triceps: Stabilize the elbow joint. [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Begin in a high plank position with hands on dumbbells, feet wider than hip-width for stability, and core braced. 
2. The Row (Pull): Lift one dumbbell towards your hip, pulling with your back muscles while keeping your core tight to stop your body from twisting. 
3. Controlled Descent: Lower the dumbbell slowly back to the starting plank position. 
4. Alternating: Switch arms and repeat, creating a dynamic anti-rotation exercise. [1, 3, 5, 9, 10]  

Key Aspects 

• Full-Body Engagement: It's a compound, functional exercise that works more than just the back. 
• Anti-Rotation: The main challenge is resisting the weight's pull to rotate your spine. 
• Stability Focus: Excellent for building overall body control and stability. [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11]

## Sandbag Overhead Hold
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Overhead_Hold
**search_query:** sandbag overhead hold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Overhead Hold (or Carry) is an isometric, full-body exercise strengthening shoulders (deltoids), upper back (traps, rhomboids, serratus), core (abs, obliques) for stability, and grip, while engaging legs and glutes to maintain upright posture against the shifting load, improving coordination and functional strength through static contraction and stabilizing muscles. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Shoulders: Deltoids (front, side, rear) work isometrically to keep the weight overhead. 
• Core: Abdominals and obliques engage intensely to prevent torso rotation and maintain stability. 
• Upper Back: Traps, rhomboids, and serratus anterior stabilize the shoulder blades. 
• Arms: Triceps assist in maintaining the press, and forearms/hands work the grip. 
• Legs & Glutes: Hamstrings, glutes, and quads stabilize the lower body and prevent leaning. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern 

• Isometric Stabilization: The primary pattern is holding a static position, requiring constant tension (isometric contraction) from multiple muscle groups, unlike dynamic movements. 
• Full-Body Coordination: It demands the entire body to work together to control the unstable, shifting sandbag, challenging neuromuscular coordination. 
• Load Management: The body learns to brace and stabilize against a variable, moving load, mimicking real-world challenges better than static weights. 
• Functional Strength: Builds strength for tasks requiring carrying heavy, awkward objects overhead, improving athletic performance and posture. [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

## Trap-Bar Static Hold
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Trap-Bar_Static_Hold
**search_query:** trap bar static hold muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 


The Trap-Bar Static Hold is an isometric exercise that primarily targets muscles responsible for stability and grip strength, drawing on the same muscle groups as a trap-bar deadlift but focusing on holding a stationary position. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 
The static hold heavily engages the following muscle groups to stabilize the body and maintain the lifting posture: 

• Core: The abdominals, obliques, and transverse abdominis are actively engaged to brace the core, stabilize the spine, and maintain a rigid torso. 
• Upper Back and Trapezius ("Traps"): These muscles work intensely to keep the shoulders stable and packed down, preventing the bar from pulling the body forward and maintaining an upright posture. 
• Forearms and Grip: The grip and forearm muscles (wrist flexors and extensors) are under constant, high tension to maintain a secure hold on the heavy bar. 
• Lower Body Stabilizers: The glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps are all engaged to support the body's position, though their function is isometric (static contraction) rather than dynamic movement. 
• Erector Spinae: These muscles along the spine contract to maintain a neutral spinal position and prevent the back from rounding. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Movement Patterns 
The Trap-Bar Static Hold is a functional anti-movement pattern exercise. 

• Isometric Hold: The primary "movement" is a lack of movement, or an isometric contraction, where muscles are engaged without changing length. 
• Anti-Flexion/Extension: The core and back muscles work against the force of gravity to resist spinal flexion (rounding) or extension (arching). 
• Anti-Lateral Flexion/Rotation: The exercise requires resisting forces that would cause the torso to bend sideways or twist, particularly if walking with the bar (a farmer's carry variation). 
• Neutral Posture: The trap bar's design allows for a more neutral, upright posture compared to a conventional barbell, which reinforces this specific biomechanically favorable position. [2, 6, 10, 12, 13]

## Weighted Pull-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Weighted_Pull-Up
**search_query:** weighted pull-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Weighted pull-ups are a compound exercise primarily targeting the back (lats, traps, rhomboids) and arms (biceps, forearms) for pulling strength, involving a vertical pulling motion with scapular retraction and elbow flexion, while also engaging the core and shoulders for stability, making it a powerful full-body movement for building upper body power. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Back & Arms): 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main muscle for pulling your body up, responsible for shoulder adduction and extension. 
    • Biceps Brachii: Flexes the elbow to lift your body. 
    • Forearm Muscles (Brachialis, Brachioradialis): Crucial for grip strength and elbow flexion. 

• Secondary Movers (Shoulders & Upper Back): 

    • Trapezius (Upper, Middle, Lower): Stabilizes and moves the shoulder blades (scapular retraction/depression). 
    • Rhomboids: Assist in retracting the shoulder blades. 
    • Posterior Deltoids (Rear Delts): Help with shoulder extension. 
    • Teres Major: Works with the lats for arm extension. 

• Stabilizers: 

    • Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques): Maintain a stable, straight trunk. 
    • Rotator Cuff Muscles (e.g., Infraspinatus): Stabilize the shoulder joint. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Hang from the bar with arms extended, engaging your core and keeping shoulders packed down (not shrugging). 
2. Concentric (Pulling) Phase: Pull your body upward by driving your elbows down and back, focusing on pulling with your lats and biceps until your chin is above the bar. 
3. Eccentric (Lowering) Phase: Slowly lower back down with control, extending your arms fully to the starting position. 
4. Compound Movement: It's a vertical pulling, multi-joint exercise that requires significant upper body strength and core stability. [1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11]

## Bulgarian Split Squat
**exercise_id:** EXERCISE:BULGARIAN_SPLIT_SQUAT
**search_query:** bulgarian split squat muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Bulgarian Split Squat (BSS) is a unilateral, multi-joint exercise primarily targeting the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings, with significant core stabilization and assistance from adductors and calves, performed in the sagittal plane with hip and knee flexion/extension. The movement pattern involves lowering the body in a deep lunge with the back foot elevated, driving up through the front heel, emphasizing hip/knee extension and flexion, requiring balance and control for unilateral strength and stability. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
This video provides a form review of the Bulgarian Split Squat: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Quadriceps: (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Lateralis/Medialis/Intermedius) for knee extension. 
    • Glutes: (Gluteus Maximus, Medius, Minimus) for hip extension and stabilization, especially the medius to prevent knee collapse. 
    • Hamstrings: (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) for hip extension and eccentric control. 

• Stabilizers & Secondary Muscles: 

    • Core: (Abs, Obliques, Spinal Erectors) to maintain balance and trunk stability. 
    • Calves: (Gastrocnemius, Soleus) for ankle stability. 
    • Adductors: (Adductor Magnus) assist with hip extension. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

You can see the primary muscles targeted in this video: 
Movement Patterns & Biomechanics 

• Plane of Motion: Sagittal plane (forward/backward movement). 
• Joint Actions: 

    • Eccentric (Downward): Knee flexion and hip flexion. 
    • Concentric (Upward): Knee extension and hip extension. 

• Key Mechanics: 

    • Unilateral Loading: Works one leg at a time, challenging balance and addressing imbalances. 
    • Hip Hinge (with forward lean): Angling the torso forward shifts focus to glutes/hamstrings; staying upright targets quads more. 
    • Controlled Eccentric: Slow lowering under load builds strength and resilience in tendons and connective tissues. 
    • Balance & Stability: Requires significant activation from core and ankle stabilizers to control movement. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

This video demonstrates the hip hinge variation of the Bulgarian Split Squat:

## AirDyne
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:AirDyne
**search_query:** airdyne muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The AirDyne machine provides a full-body, low-impact workout by engaging all major muscle groups through a dual-action pushing and pulling movement pattern. [1, 2]  
Muscles Worked 
The exercise distributes the workload across both the upper and lower body, as well as engaging the core for stability. [3]  
Lower Body: 

• Quadriceps: Engaged during the pushing phase of the pedal stroke. 
• Hamstrings: Worked during the pulling/lifting phase of the pedal stroke. 
• Glutes: Primarily engaged during pedaling. 
• Calves: Activated with each revolution of the pedals. 
• Hip Flexors: Involved in the cyclical leg motion. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Upper Body: 

• Pectorals (Chest): Used when pushing the handlebars forward. 
• Deltoids (Shoulders): Engaged during both the pushing and pulling actions. 
• Latissimus Dorsi (Back): Worked when pulling the handlebars backward. 
• Biceps: Engaged as part of the pulling motion. 
• Triceps: Engaged as part of the pushing motion. [1, 3]  

Core: 

• Abdominals and Obliques: Engaged throughout the exercise to stabilize the body and transfer power efficiently between the upper and lower limbs. 
• Lower Back (Erector Spinae): Also helps in maintaining a stable and upright posture. [1, 3, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Patterns 
The AirDyne uses a reciprocal, dual-action movement pattern that mimics natural human motion, making it a functional exercise. 

• Lower Body: The movement is a continuous, cyclical pedaling action that is primarily concentric (muscle shortening) in nature, with very little eccentric (braking) action, which reduces post-workout soreness compared to high-impact exercises like running. 
• Upper Body: The user performs a constant horizontal pushing and pulling motion on the moving handlebars in coordination with the leg movement. This coordinated, full-body action improves inter-limb coordination and ensures the workload is distributed, leading to a high-intensity cardiovascular workout without excessive strain on any single muscle group or joint. [2, 4, 11, 12, 13]  

The resistance is provided by a large fan flywheel, meaning the harder and faster one pushes and pulls, the greater the air resistance becomes, providing infinite scalability and suitability for both steady-state cardio and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). [14, 15]

## Sandbag Push Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Push_Press
**search_query:** sandbag push press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Push Press is a full-body power movement engaging legs (glutes, quads, calves), core (abs, obliques, spinal erectors), shoulders (deltoids), upper back (traps, lats), and arms (triceps) for a dynamic overhead press, using a slight dip and drive to generate force, making it highly functional for athletic power and stability due to the shifting weight, notes Dingo Sandbags (https://www.dingosandbags.com.au/frequently-asked-questions/sandbag-overhead-press/), CrossFit (https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-push-press), SET FOR SET (https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/push-press), and MIKOLO (https://gym-mikolo.com/blogs/home-gym/push-press-muscles-worked-and-benefits). The shifting sandbag demands increased core and shoulder stabilizer activation for balance and coordination, unlike a stable barbell. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Legs: Glutes, Quadriceps (Vastus Medialis, Lateralis, Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Hamstrings, Calves. 
• Core: Abdominals (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis), Spinal Erectors. 
• Shoulders: Deltoids (Anterior, Lateral, Posterior). 
• Upper Back: Trapezius (Traps), Latissimus Dorsi (Lats). 
• Arms: Triceps (for lockout). 
• Chest: Pectorals (assists pressing). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Hold the sandbag at shoulder height (the "rack" position). 
2. Dip Phase: Perform a quick, shallow squat by bending at the hips, knees, and ankles, keeping your torso upright. 
3. Drive Phase: Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles (like jumping) to generate upward momentum. 
4. Press Phase: As you extend your legs, press the sandbag overhead with your arms, locking out your elbows at the top. 
5. Catch/Finish: Receive the weight in a stable overhead position, then return it to the rack or the floor. [3, 4, 8, 9, 10]  

Key Aspect (Sandbag) 

• Shifting Load: The unstable nature of the sandbag forces deep engagement of core stabilizers and shoulder girdle muscles (medial/posterior delts, traps) to control the weight, enhancing functional strength and coordination. [1, 5]

## Trap Bar Romanian Deadlift
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Trap_Bar_Romanian_Deadlift
**search_query:** trap bar romanian deadlift muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Trap Bar Romanian Deadlift (RDL) is a hip-hinge movement primarily targeting the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lower back/erector spinae), but also involves quads, traps, lats, core, and grip. The movement pattern involves a controlled hip hinge with a slight knee bend, keeping the back flat and core tight, moving the bar vertically down the thighs and back up by driving the hips forward and squeezing the glutes, minimizing spinal rounding for a gentler back alternative to traditional RDLs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
This video demonstrates the correct form for a Trap Bar Romanian Deadlift: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: Glutes, Hamstrings, Erector Spinae (Lower Back). 
• Secondary/Stabilizers: Quadriceps (more than traditional RDLs), Traps, Lats, Core, Forearms/Grip, Adductors, Calves. [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern (Hip Hinge) 

1. Setup: Stand inside the trap bar with feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, shoulders back and down, chest up, and a flat back, holding the bar at your midline. 
2. Descent (Hinge): Push hips backward, keeping the slight knee bend, lowering the bar vertically along your thighs towards the floor (stopping around shin level). 
3. Ascent (Extend): Drive hips forward, squeeze glutes to return to standing, maintaining a flat back and neutral spine. [2, 5, 9, 10, 11]  

Key Characteristics 

• Back-Friendly: The center of gravity with the trap bar reduces lower back strain compared to barbell RDLs. 
• Posterior Chain Focus: Excellent for developing the entire backside of the body. 
• Compound Movement: Works multiple muscle groups for functional strength. [2, 3, 5, 8]

## Kneeling Ab Wheel
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Kneeling_Ab_Wheel
**search_query:** ab wheel rollout muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Kneeling Ab Wheel Rollout primarily targets your core (rectus abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis) for anti-extension, while also engaging your lats, pecs, triceps, shoulders, and glutes for stability and control as you extend and return. The movement pattern is an anti-extension exercise, forcing your core to resist spinal flexion (arching) as you roll out, and then contract powerfully to pull the wheel back in, working eccentrically and concentrically through a large range of motion. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary Movers/Stabilizers: 

    • Rectus Abdominis: The "six-pack" muscles, working hard to prevent your back from arching (anti-extension). 
    • Obliques (Internal & External): Stabilize the torso and prevent sideways tilting or rotation. 
    • Transverse Abdominis: The deep core muscle, crucial for spinal stability. 

• Secondary/Assisting Muscles: 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Assist in pulling the wheel back and stabilizing the shoulders. 
    • Pectoralis Major (Pecs): Engage to help control the arm extension. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Helps protract the shoulder blades. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Keep hips stable and prevent sagging. 
    • Triceps & Shoulders: Stabilize the arms and shoulders in the extended position. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern: 

1. Starting Position: Kneel on the floor, hands on the wheel, arms extended, abs tight, back flat. 
2. Eccentric Phase (Roll Out): Slowly roll the wheel forward, extending your arms and hips, maintaining a rigid, straight line from knees to shoulders (like an extended plank). This is the lengthening (eccentric) phase, where the core resists gravity. 
3. Isometric Hold (Optional): Pause at the furthest point you can control without your lower back sagging. 
4. Concentric Phase (Roll In): Engage your abs and lats to pull the wheel back to the starting position, overcoming gravity. [1, 4, 6, 9]  

Key Technique: 

• Control is key: Avoid letting your lower back arch; the core does the work to prevent extension. 
• Slow and controlled: Focus on the eccentric (out) and concentric (in) phases, not speed. 
• Start small: Begin with shorter rollouts and gradually increase range as strength improves. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

## Weighted Dead Hang
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Weighted_Dead_Hang
**search_query:** dead hang muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

A Weighted Dead Hang is an isometric exercise primarily strengthening your grip (forearms/hands), back (lats, traps, rhomboids), and shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), while intensely engaging your core (abs, obliques) for stability, with spinal decompression as a major benefit, working muscles isometrically to build endurance and functional strength, not through traditional movement patterns. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Grip & Arms: Forearm flexors, hand muscles, wrist flexors. 
• Back: Latissimus dorsi (lats), trapezius (traps), rhomboids. 
• Shoulders: Deltoids, rotator cuff muscles, serratus anterior. 
• Core: Rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, erector spinae (deep stabilizers). 
• Legs (Stabilizers): Glutes, quads. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern 

• Isometric Contraction: Muscles are held under tension without changing length, focusing on stabilization rather than movement. 
• Scapular Stability: Teaches shoulder blades to depress and retract, stabilizing the shoulder girdle. 
• Spinal Decompression: Gravity lengthens the spine, creating space between vertebrae. [1, 3, 4, 9, 10]  

How It Works 

• Grip Strength: Holding the weight significantly increases the demand on your hands and forearms. 
• Core Stability: Your core works hard to prevent your body from swinging and maintain alignment. 
• Full-Body Tension: Creates full-body tension, especially in the upper back, shoulders, and arms, improving posture and upper body endurance. [3, 4, 5, 7]

## Sandbag Box Squat
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Box_Squat
**search_query:** box squat muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Sandbag box squats work your quads, glutes, hamstrings, core, and posterior chain, with added demands on your upper back, forearms, and biceps due to stabilizing the shifting sandbag. The movement pattern involves sitting back onto a box (like a chair), activating hip hinges for posterior chain strength, and then exploding up, improving power and functional strength by mimicking real-world lifting of bulky items. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Legs): Quadriceps, Glutes, Hamstrings, Adductors (inner thighs). 
• Stabilizers & Support: 

    • Core: Abs, obliques, and spinal erectors (lower back) to keep your torso upright. 
    • Upper Back: To maintain posture and control the weight. 
    • Forearms & Biceps: For grip strength to hold the unstable sandbag. 
    • Calves: To stabilize the lower leg. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Hip Hinge: Sitting back onto the box emphasizes hip movement, activating the glutes and hamstrings more than a traditional squat. 
• Posterior Chain Focus: Excellent for building strength in the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back (the backside of your body). 
• Strength-Endurance: High reps build significant muscular endurance and systemic strength, transferring to other movements. 
• Functional Strength: The unstable nature of the sandbag mimics lifting heavy, awkward objects (like a box or bag of soil), improving real-world lifting ability. 
• Power Development: The brief pause (or relaxation) on the box allows for a powerful concentric (pushing up) phase, building explosive power. 
• Core & Grip Challenge: The shifting weight constantly engages your core and grip, making it a comprehensive full-body exercise. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]

**retrieved_at:** 

The Viking Press primarily targets the shoulders (deltoids), along with the triceps and upper chest (pectoralis major), while engaging the core, traps, and back for stabilization, using a dynamic, momentum-driven pattern similar to a push press or jerk, allowing for heavy weight lifting by dipping the knees and driving the weight up. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
This video demonstrates the correct form for the Viking Press: 
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Deltoids: Anterior (front) and lateral (side) heads are heavily recruited for pressing overhead, say Garage Gym Reviews (https://www.garagegymreviews.com/viking-press), Onnit (https://www.onnit.com/blogs/the-edge/how-to-do-the-viking-press-like-an-expert), and trainingstation.co.uk (https://trainingstation.co.uk/blogs/news/what-is-a-viking-press). 
    • Triceps Brachii: Extend the elbows to lock out the weight, note Garage Gym Reviews, Onnit, and trainingstation.co.uk. 
    • Pectoralis Major (Clavicular Head): Assists with shoulder flexion, say Garage Gym Reviews and Lippincott (https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2021/10000/the_viking_press.12.aspx). 

• Stabilizers: 

    • Core (Abs & Obliques): Braces the torso and maintains stability, according to Garage Gym Reviews and trainingstation.co.uk. 
    • Trapezius & Upper Back: Help stabilize the shoulder girdle and assist with scapular movement, note Onnit and trainingstation.co.uk. 
    • Serratus Anterior: Stabilizes the shoulder blades, note Garage Gym Reviews and Lippincott. [1, 3, 5, 6]  

This video provides variations of the Viking Press, including kneeling and standing: 
Movement Pattern (Dynamic/Momentum-Based) 

1. Dip: A quick, shallow bend in the knees and hips to load the lower body, say BarBend, Generation Iron, and Garage Gym Reviews. 
2. Drive (Legs/Hips): Explosively extend the ankles, knees, and hips to propel the weight upward, using momentum [2, 3, 4, 7]

## Rowing Machine
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Rowing_Machine
**search_query:** rowing machine muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Rowing machines work almost all major muscles in a full-body, coordinated sequence: legs (quads, hamstrings, glutes) for the powerful push, core (abs, lower back) for stabilization, and upper body (lats, traps, rhomboids, biceps, forearms, shoulders, triceps) for the pull, following the four phases: Catch (start position), Drive (leg push, torso swing, arm pull), Finish (end position), and Recovery (return to catch), making it a low-impact, comprehensive workout. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked by Muscle Group 

• Legs: Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves (power generation). 
• Core: Abdominals, obliques, lower back (stabilization, torso movement). 
• Back: Latissimus dorsi (lats), trapezius (traps), rhomboids (pulling strength, posture). 
• Arms/Shoulders: Biceps, triceps, deltoids, forearms (pulling, finishing the stroke). [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Rowing Movement Patterns (Phases) 

1. The Catch: Start with knees bent, shins vertical, torso leaning forward, arms extended; engages hamstrings, calves, triceps (holding handle). 
2. The Drive: Push powerfully with legs, swing torso open, pull handle to abdomen; engages quads, glutes, core, lats, biceps. 
3. The Finish: Torso upright, legs extended, handle at chest; engages glutes, abs, lats, biceps. 
4. The Recovery: Return to the catch position by extending arms, then bending knees; engages hamstrings, glutes, calves, triceps. [1, 2, 8, 9]  

Key Takeaway 
Rowing efficiently distributes effort, with about 60% from the legs, 20% from the core, and 20% from the upper body, making it a full-body exercise for strength and endurance, notes RP3 Rowing (https://rp3rowing.com/blog-items/what-muscles-does-rowing-strengthen/) and Hydrow. [2, 4]

## Sandbag Floor Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Floor_Press
**search_query:** floor press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Floor Press primarily targets the chest (pectorals), shoulders (deltoids), and triceps, with significant core engagement due to the unstable, shifting load that challenges stabilization and promotes a strong mind-muscle connection by forcing you to "squeeze the bag". The movement pattern is a horizontal pressing motion, like a bench press but limited by the floor, requiring you to press straight up from the chest until arm lockout and lower until elbows touch down, building functional pushing strength and shoulder stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) 

• Primary: 

    • Pectoralis Major (Chest): The main driver for pushing the weight up. 
    • Deltoids (Shoulders): Assists in pressing overhead and stabilizing. 
    • Triceps: Extends the elbows to finish the press. 

• Secondary/Stabilizers: 

    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis): Crucial for maintaining stability as the sand shifts. 
    • Lats & Upper Back: Engaged to control the weight down and provide stability. [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern (Pushing Pattern) 

1. Setup: Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat, and the sandbag on your hips/chest. 
2. Initiation: Press the bag up by extending your arms, keeping elbows at a controlled angle, not flared out. 
3. Press: Drive the bag straight up, squeezing it to create tension, controlling the unstable load. 
4. Descent: Lower the bag with control until your elbows lightly touch the floor, maintaining tension. 
5. Function: This pattern builds pushing power and improves shoulder health by eliminating over-extension, making it great for athletes with shoulder issues or those seeking functional strength. [1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10]

## One-Arm Dead Hang
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:One-Arm_Dead_Hang
**search_query:** one arm dead hang muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The One-Arm Dead Hang is an advanced isometric exercise primarily targeting forearm flexors, grip strength, shoulder stabilizers (like rotator cuff), lats, and core to prevent twisting, with significant activation in traps and biceps for stability. The movement pattern involves an isometric hold where your entire body weight is supported by one arm, demanding immense unilateral strength, improving shoulder health, and correcting imbalances, making it a potent preparation for advanced calisthenics like one-arm pull-ups. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Forearms: Deep forearm muscles (flexors) work intensely to maintain the grip. 
• Grip: Finger flexors and intrinsic hand muscles are heavily challenged. 
• Shoulders: Rotator cuff, deltoids, and scapular stabilizers (traps, rhomboids) build stability and strength in a deep range of motion. 
• Back: Latissimus dorsi (lats) and trapezius (traps) engage to keep the shoulder girdle stable and stretched. 
• Core: Abdominals and obliques work isometrically to prevent your body from swinging or rotating. 
• Biceps: Engage to assist in stabilizing the elbow and shoulder. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Grip: Grab a pull-up bar with one hand, using a pronated (overhand) or supinated (underhand) grip. 
2. Support: Hang with your body suspended, keeping your arm extended or slightly bent. 
3. Stability (Isometric): Your core and upper back muscles contract to keep your torso still and prevent swaying. 
4. Duration: Hold for a set time, focusing on deep breathing and maintaining tension. 
5. Unilateral Challenge: The key is that one arm supports your total body weight, forcing extreme unilateral strength development. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

## Sandbag Overhead Carry
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Overhead_Carry
**search_query:** overhead carry muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Overhead Carry is a total-body isometric exercise challenging shoulders (deltoids, traps, stabilizers), core (abs, obliques, lower back), and back (lats, rhomboids) to stabilize the unstable load, while also working grip (forearms), legs (glutes, quads), and posterior chain for overall stability and functional strength, forcing continuous micro-adjustments for balance, posture, and neuromuscular control. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Shoulders (Deltoids): Isometrically contract to hold the weight overhead. 
• Scapular Stabilizers (Traps, Rhomboids, Serratus): Work hard to keep the shoulder blades stable. 
• Core (Abdominals, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Resist trunk extension and lateral flexion to keep your spine neutral. 
• Upper Back (Lats, Traps): Prevent the load from collapsing and help keep shoulders down. 
• Grip & Forearms: Engage intensely to maintain hold on the shifting sandbag. 
• Legs & Glutes: Provide a stable base and help maintain posture, working isometrically. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Isometric Stabilization: Muscles contract without significant movement to hold the load steady. 
• Total Body Integration: Demands simultaneous work from upper and lower body for stability. 
• Unstable Load Adaptation: The shifting sandbag forces greater activation of stabilizers and enhances motor control. 
• Functional Strength: Mimics real-life carrying, improving posture, balance, and everyday lifting ability. 
• Core Stability: Builds control over the spine, preventing arching and hyperextension. 
• Neuromuscular Coordination: Improves communication between the nervous system and muscles for better control and agility. [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]

## Running
**exercise_id:** EXERCISE:Running
**search_query:** running muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Running heavily engages your lower body (glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves) for propulsion and shock absorption, your core (abdominals, obliques, erector spinae) for stability and posture, and your hip flexors to drive the leg forward, all working in coordinated patterns like hip flexion/extension, knee extension/flexion, and ankle plantarflexion through distinct stance (landing, support) and swing (flight) phases to create continuous forward motion. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Key Muscles Worked 

• Glutes (Maximus, Medius, Minimus): Extend the hip powerfully and stabilize the pelvis, especially uphill or during flight. 
• Quadriceps (Vasti, Rectus Femoris): Control impact upon landing and extend the knee for push-off. 
• Hamstrings: Extend the hip and help bend the knee during the stride cycle, powering forward movement. 
• Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas, Rectus Femoris): Lift the knee and drive the leg forward during the swing phase. 
• Calves (Gastrocnemius, Soleus): Store and release elastic energy for the final push-off and absorb ground impact. 
• Core (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Maintain upright posture, control trunk rotation, and connect upper and lower body power. [1, 3, 5, 6]  

Running Movement Patterns (Gait Cycle) 
Running involves alternating between stance phase (foot on the ground) and swing phase (foot in the air), with key actions: 

1. Landing/Stance: Foot strikes, quads and calves absorb shock and stabilize the knee and ankle. 
2. Mid-Stance: Body weight shifts forward, glutes and hamstrings extend the hip. 
3. Toe-Off/Push-Off: Calves and quads powerfully extend the ankle and knee for propulsion. 
4. Swing Phase: Hip flexors and quads lift the leg forward as the hamstring shortens and relaxes the calf, preparing for the next landing. [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]  

How They Work Together 

• Propulsion: Glutes and hamstrings powerfully extend the hip, while calves push off the ground. 
• Stability: The core keeps your torso stable, while gluteus medius prevents the pelvis from dropping. 
• Shock Absorption: Quads and calves control the impact as your foot hits the ground. [1, 3, 5]

## Scap Push-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Scap_Push-Up
**search_query:** scapular push-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Scap Push-Ups primarily target the Serratus Anterior (protraction) and Rhomboids (retraction) for shoulder blade stability, alongside the Traps, Pecs, and Core, using a movement pattern of scapular protraction (pushing shoulder blades apart) and retraction (squeezing them together) in a plank, focusing on shoulder movement without bending elbows to build shoulder health and posture. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Serratus Anterior: Key for pushing shoulder blades away from the spine (protraction). 
    • Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Squeeze shoulder blades together (retraction). 

• Stabilizers & Synergists: 

    • Trapezius (Upper, Middle, Lower): Assists in elevation, depression, and stabilization. 
    • Pectoralis Minor: Helps with protraction. 
    • Levator Scapulae: Connects shoulder blade to neck, aids elevation. 
    • Core (Abs, Obliques): Keeps the body in a rigid plank. [1, 2, 3, 5]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: High plank with hands under shoulders, elbows straight, body in a straight line. 
2. Protraction (Pushing Away): Push your upper body away from the floor by spreading your shoulder blades apart, rounding your upper back slightly; keep elbows locked. 
3. Retraction (Squeezing In): Allow your chest to sink towards the floor as you squeeze your shoulder blades together, bringing your body lower. 
4. Repetition: Smoothly transition between protraction and retraction, moving only the shoulder blades, not bending elbows or sagging the back. [1, 3, 6, 7]

## Elbow Plank
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Elbow_Plank
**search_query:** plank muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The elbow plank (forearm plank) is an isometric, full-body exercise primarily targeting your core (transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, obliques) for stability, while also engaging shoulders, back (lats, traps, rhomboids), arms (triceps, biceps), glutes, quads, and hip flexors, all working to maintain a rigid, neutral spine against gravity, building endurance for functional movements. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked (Isometric Contraction) 

• Core: Transverse Abdominis (deepest), Rectus Abdominis ("six-pack"), Obliques (sides). 
• Shoulders: Deltoids (stabilize), Serratus Anterior (shoulder blade stability). 
• Back: Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius, Rhomboids (support spine). 
• Arms: Triceps (stabilize elbows), Biceps (assist). 
• Glutes & Hips: Gluteus Maximus (hip extension, alignment), Hip Flexors (pelvic stability). 
• Legs: Quadriceps, Hamstrings (keep legs straight and engaged). [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Movement Pattern (Static Hold) 

• Type: Isometric exercise (muscles contract without changing length). 
• Action: Your body forms a straight line from head to heels, resisting gravity. 
• Key Focus: Deep core engagement to prevent sagging or arching of the lower back, maintaining a neutral spine. [1, 2, 7, 10]  

How It Works (Functional Movement) 
Planks build functional strength, making everyday activities like walking, carrying, and lifting easier by improving overall body tension and stability, especially for your core, which protects your lower back. [1, 6]

## Sandbag Strict Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Strict_Press
**search_query:** strict press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Strict Press is a compound exercise building total-body strength, heavily targeting the deltoids, triceps, and upper back for the press itself, while engaging the core (abs, obliques, lower back) and legs (glutes, hamstrings) for stabilization, creating a dynamic, functional movement that enhances shoulder stability, grip, and coordination due to the shifting sand load. Key movement patterns include shoulder flexion, scapular stabilization, and intense core bracing to manage the uneven weight. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked: 

• Primary Movers (Upper Body): 

    • Deltoids (Shoulders): All three heads (anterior, lateral, posterior) work to lift the weight overhead, especially the front delts. 
    • Triceps: Extend the elbow to lock out the press. 
    • Upper Back (Traps, Rhomboids, Serratus Anterior): Stabilize the shoulder blades and maintain posture. 

• Stabilizers (Whole Body): 

    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Lower Back): Constantly brace and adjust to the shifting sand for spinal stability. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: Provide a solid base and help generate force, crucial for overall stability. 
    • Forearms & Grip: Work hard to maintain control of the unstable sandbag. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Movement Patterns: 

• Shoulder Flexion: The primary action of raising the arm overhead. 
• Scapular Stabilization: Retracting and controlling the shoulder blades to create a stable platform. 
• Core Bracing & Anti-Rotation: The uneven load forces intense core engagement to prevent leaning or twisting. 
• Hip Hinging (Setup): Often involves a slight hip hinge to get the bag into the rack position. 
• Full-Body Integration: The sandbag demands total body tension, linking the lower body, core, and upper body for a synergistic effort. [1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11]  

Key Sandbag Element: 

• Dynamic Load: The shifting sand requires constant micro-adjustments, challenging stabilizer muscles more than a rigid barbell, improving functional strength and coordination. [2, 5, 9]

## Boxing
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Boxing
**search_query:** boxing muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Boxing is a full-body workout demanding power from legs and hips, rotation from the core (abs, obliques, lower back), and explosive force from the shoulders (deltoids, serratus anterior) and arms (triceps, biceps), coordinated through complex movement patterns like rotational force generation, dynamic stabilization, and horizontal/vertical pushing/pulling for a powerful, balanced punch and agile footwork, relying on the entire kinetic chain for effective striking and defense. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Key Muscles Worked: 

• Core: Abs (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis), obliques, lower back for rotational power and stability. 
• Lower Body: Glutes, quadriceps, calves, hamstrings, hip flexors for generating power from the ground up and maintaining stance. 
• Upper Body (Pushing): Deltoids, pectorals, triceps for extending the punch. 
• Upper Body (Pulling/Stabilizing): Biceps (retraction, hooks), latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, trapezius (balancing push power). 
• Shoulder Girdle: Serratus anterior ("boxer's muscle") for scapular protraction (punching motion). [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  

Key Movement Patterns: 

• Rotational Power: Initiated in the legs, transferred through the hips and core to the upper body, like a coiled spring releasing energy. 
• Horizontal Pushing: Jabs, crosses, hooks (chest, shoulders, triceps). 
• Vertical Pushing: Uppercuts (shoulders, triceps). 
• Pulling/Retraction: Returning the arm to guard (biceps, back muscles). 
• Dynamic Stabilization: Core and lower body maintaining balance and stance during movement. 
• Lower Body Drive: Constant shifting, bouncing, and driving power from the ground (hip/knee dominance). [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10]  

In essence, boxing uses the whole body as a kinetic chain, turning ground force into punching power through coordinated muscle engagement and movement patterns. [2, 11]

**search_query:** v-sit kettlebell pass muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Kettlebell (KB) V-Sit Pass-Over (also known as a V-sit with pass the weight, or a variation of a kettlebell figure-eight in a V-sit) is a demanding core exercise that primarily engages your abdominal muscles and hip flexors through controlled rotation and stability. [1, 2]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary: 

    • Rectus Abdominis: The "six-pack" muscles are heavily engaged to maintain the V-sit position and stabilize the torso. 
    • Obliques (External and Internal): These muscles are targeted as you twist and pass the kettlebell from side to side, controlling the rotational movement. 
    • Hip Flexors: These muscles work hard to keep your legs elevated and maintain the "V" shape. 
    • Transverse Abdominis: The deep core muscles act as stabilizers to protect the spine and maintain balance throughout the movement. 

• Secondary/Stabilizers: 

    • Erector Spinae: These lower back muscles help maintain an upright posture and prevent the back from rounding. 
    • Shoulders and Arms: The muscles in your shoulders, biceps, triceps, and forearms are engaged to hold and control the kettlebell, improving grip strength and shoulder stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  

Movement Patterns 
The KB V-Sit Pass-Over incorporates several functional movement patterns: 

• Trunk Rotation/Anti-Rotation: The core must stabilize the body while the upper body rotates to pass the weight, building core control and strength. 
• Core Stabilization: The exercise requires significant isometric strength to hold the V-sit position and resist the force of the moving kettlebell trying to pull you off balance. 
• Flexion/Extension Control: Maintaining the balance in the V-sit requires continuous control over the flexion of the hips and stabilization of the spine. 
• Coordination and Balance: The dynamic nature of passing the kettlebell around and between the legs challenges balance and hand-eye coordination. [1, 5, 6, 7, 9]

• Core: Obliques, Transverse Abdominis, Quadratus Lumborum (QL) (primary stabilizers against side bending). 
• Upper Body: Forearms & Grip, Deltoids, Traps, Lats, Rhomboids (shoulder stability, arm strength). 
• Lower Body: Glutes, Hip Stabilizers, Quads, Hamstrings, Calves (balance and hip alignment). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Setup: Stand tall, shoulders back and down, chest out, holding a heavy dumbbell or kettlebell in one hand at your side, away from your body. 
2. Action: Walk slowly and deliberately, focusing on staying upright. 
3. Core Engagement (Anti-Lateral Flexion): Your core muscles (especially the obliques on the opposite side) contract isometrically to prevent your torso from tilting or bending towards the weight. 
4. Maintain Posture: Keep your hips level and avoid leaning away from the weight. 
5. Repetition: Walk a set distance or time, then switch hands. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11]  

Why It's Effective 

• Functional Strength: Trains your body to handle uneven loads, like real-life tasks. 
• Core Stability: Excellent for developing strong, stable, and resilient core muscles. 
• Improves Posture: Strengthens back and core muscles to maintain an upright stance. 
• Unilateral Training: Addresses strength imbalances between sides, which often develop from daily activities. [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]

## Sledgehammer Tire Slams
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sledgehammer_Tire_Slams
**search_query:** sledgehammer tire slam muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

Sledgehammer tire slams are a full-body power and conditioning exercise, engaging the shoulders, back (lats, traps), core (abs, obliques), arms (biceps, triceps), glutes, and legs (hamstrings, quads), working in a dynamic, explosive vertical/diagonal swinging motion that transfers power from the hips through the core and arms, improving functional strength, endurance, and coordination across multiple planes of motion. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
This video demonstrates how to perform a sledgehammer tire slam: 
Muscles Worked 

• Upper Body: Deltoids (shoulders), Traps, Lats, Biceps, Triceps, Forearms, Grip. 
• Core: Abdominals (abs) and Obliques. 
• Lower Body: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads (especially in initiating the swing). [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns & Key Mechanics 

1. Power Generation: The movement starts from the ground up, using the legs and hips to drive power, similar to a kettlebell swing or hang clean. 
2. Explosive Swing: A fluid, arc-like motion brings the hammer overhead, engaging the entire posterior chain and shoulders. 
3. Core Stabilization: The core rapidly stabilizes the torso as the weight moves overhead and drives down. 
4. Rotational Strength: Slams involve movement in multiple planes, enhancing rotational power, especially with variations like one-handed "Tomahawks" or diagonal swings. 
5. Full-Body Coordination: Requires synchronizing upper body, core, and lower body for efficient power transfer and impact absorption. [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]  

You can also watch this video to see the power of the tire slam: 
Key Benefits 

• Full-Body Conditioning: Works almost every muscle for overall strength and endurance. 
• Power & Explosiveness: Develops explosive power and athletic performance. 
• Muscular Endurance: Repetitive motion builds endurance in key areas. 
• Functional Strength: Mimics real-world power transfer needed in many sports. [1, 2, 4, 5, 9]

## Sandbag Row
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Row
**search_query:** sandbag row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Row (Bent-Over) is a compound pulling movement targeting the upper back (traps, rhomboids, lats), with significant assistance from the biceps, forearms (grip strength), and shoulders, while the core, glutes, and hamstrings stabilize the whole body due to the shifting weight, building functional strength and improving posture. Its primary pattern is a hip hinge (like a deadlift) combined with a pulling/rowing motion, challenging stabilizer muscles more than rigid weights. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Pulling): 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): For pulling the bag towards the body. 
    • Trapezius (Traps): Mid and upper traps for shoulder blade retraction. 
    • Rhomboids: Between shoulder blades, crucial for scapular stability. 

• Assisting Muscles: 

    • Biceps & Forearms: For elbow flexion and intense grip strength due to the unstable load. 
    • Posterior Deltoids (Rear Shoulders): Help with pulling and stabilization. 

• Stabilizers (Core & Lower Body): 

    • Core (Abs, Obliques, Erectors): To prevent torso rotation and maintain a rigid spine. 
    • Glutes & Hamstrings: To support the hip hinge and keep the lower body stable. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns 

1. Hip Hinge: Bending at the hips with a slight knee bend, similar to a Romanian Deadlift (RDL), to pick up the bag. 
2. Pull/Row: Driving the elbows back and squeezing shoulder blades together to pull the bag to the torso. 
3. Scapular Control: Actively retracting and controlling the shoulder blades due to the sandbag's shifting weight, enhancing stability. 
4. Core Engagement: Constant tension to keep the torso stable and prevent rounding, making it a full-body functional movement. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  

Key Benefits 

• Functional Strength: Mimics lifting awkward, real-world objects. 
• Enhanced Grip: Demands significant hand and forearm strength. 
• Improved Posture: Strengthens upper back and scapular stabilizers. 
• Core Stability: Forces intense core activation. [2, 3, 4]

## Sandbag Good Morning
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_Good_Morning
**search_query:** good morning exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag Good Morning is a hip-hinge movement that heavily targets your posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, lower back/erector spinae) for strength and mobility, forcing core stabilization, while the sandbag's shifting weight demands more coordination than a barbell, building functional strength in a natural, life-like motion. You push hips back, lower torso with a flat back, feeling a stretch in the hamstrings, then drive hips forward to stand, engaging glutes and hamstrings to lift. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
Muscles Worked (Posterior Chain & Core) 

• Primary Movers (Hip Extension): Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus. 
• Stabilizers (Spinal Extension): Erector Spinae (lower back muscles). 
• Core/Stabilization: Abdominals and obliques work isometrically to maintain a rigid, neutral spine, preventing rounding. [2, 5, 8, 9]  

Movement Pattern (Hip Hinge) 

1. Setup: Shoulder the sandbag, stand hip-width apart, chest up, shoulders back, knees slightly bent (not deep). 
2. Hinge (Eccentric Phase): Push your hips backward, allowing your chest to fall forward while maintaining a flat, neutral spine (like bowing). 
3. Depth: Lower until your torso is near parallel to the floor or you feel a deep stretch in your hamstrings. 
4. Return (Concentric Phase): Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to drive your hips forward, returning to the starting upright position. [1, 2, 4, 6]  

Key Takeaway 
The sandbag's unstable nature recruits more stabilizing muscles and develops functional strength, mimicking real-world lifting patterns better than traditional weighted exercises. [3, 7]

## Sandbag March
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Sandbag_March
**search_query:** sandbag march muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Sandbag March is a dynamic exercise that builds functional strength, targeting your legs (quads, glutes, hamstrings), core (abs, obliques, lower back) for stability, and upper back/shoulders to maintain posture, working through the locomotion/marching movement pattern to improve balance, coordination, and endurance, mimicking real-world movement. It's excellent for training your body to move as an integrated system, unlike static exercises. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers (Legs): Glutes, Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Hip Flexors. 
• Core (Stabilizers): Abdominals, Obliques, Erector Spinae (lower back). 
• Upper Body (Stabilizers): Upper Back (Rhomboids, Traps), Rear Deltoids, Lats (to keep the bag tight). [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]  

Movement Patterns & Benefits 

• Locomotion: It's a fundamental walking pattern, enhancing balance and preventing shuffling. 
• Dynamic Stability: The unstable nature of the sandbag forces deep core engagement to prevent swaying, improving anti-rotation and anti-extension. 
• Single-Leg Strength: It trains single-leg stability and coordination, crucial for walking, running, and reducing fall risk. 
• Posterior Chain Activation: Works the glutes and hamstrings together, vital for power and stability. 
• Full-Body Integration: Connects upper body tension (pulling handles apart) with lower body movement, building resilient, connected strength. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]  

How It Works (Bear Hug Carry Example) 

1. Grab the Sandbag: Bear-hug it tightly to your chest for maximum core/upper back engagement. 
2. March: Lift one knee high (engaging hip flexors) while keeping your torso tall and stable. 
3. Maintain Tension: "Pull" the handles apart to keep the upper back engaged and prevent rounding. 
4. Coordinate: Your core and glutes work together to stabilize your pelvis and body as you move through single-leg stances. [2, 4, 7, 8]

## Jefferson Curl
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Jefferson_Curl
**search_query:** jefferson curl muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Jefferson Curl works the entire posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, erector spinae, calves) and core, emphasizing spinal articulation through controlled vertebral flexion (forward bending), improving mobility, resilience, and end-range strength in the spine and hamstrings, while strengthening the back eccentrically as you lower and concentrically as you lift. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Posterior Chain: Hamstrings, glutes, calves, erector spinae (lower and upper back). 
• Core: Deep spinal stabilizers, promoting trunk control. [1, 3, 4]  

Movement Pattern: Controlled Spinal Articulation 

1. Setup: Stand on a raised surface (box, step) holding a light weight (kettlebell/dumbbell) with straight arms, feet hip-width apart, knees locked. 
2. Descent (Eccentric): Tuck chin to chest, then slowly roll down one vertebra at a time, rounding the spine segment by segment (upper back, mid-back, lower back), pushing the weight forward to deepen the stretch. 
3. Bottom: Reach the weight forward, pause briefly, and breathe calmly. 
4. Ascent (Concentric): Uncurl back up one vertebra at a time, reversing the motion from the lower back up to the neck. [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  

Key Aspects 

• Loaded Stretch: It's a deep, loaded stretch for the hamstrings and spine. 
• Spinal Mobility: Enhances flexibility and control through spinal flexion and extension. 
• Eccentric Strength: Builds strength in the back muscles as they lengthen under load. 
• Progressive: Start with bodyweight or very light weight, prioritizing form over load, and gradually increase weight or range of motion. [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]

## Helms Row
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Helms_Row
**search_query:** helms row muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Helms Row, a chest-supported incline dumbbell row, primarily targets the Latissimus Dorsi (Lats) for back width, while also engaging the Rhomboids, Traps, and Rear Deltoids, with Biceps assisting elbow flexion, focusing on shoulder extension and scapular retraction for a strong lat-focused pull. Its movement pattern is a controlled pulling motion, initiating from the lats by pulling elbows back toward the hips/ribs, emphasizing lat engagement by removing lower back stabilization and allowing for greater focus on upper back development. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Movers: 

    • Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main muscle for that "V-taper" look, responsible for pulling the arms down and back. 

• Synergists (Assisting Muscles): 

    • Rhomboids: Help retract the shoulder blades. 
    • Traps (Trapezius): Stabilize the shoulder girdle and upper back. 
    • Rear Deltoids (Posterior Deltoids): Assist with shoulder extension. 
    • Biceps: Flex the elbow as you pull. [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]  

Movement Pattern (How it Works) 

1. Setup: Lie chest-down on an incline bench (around 30-45 degrees) with dumbbells hanging, palms neutral (facing in). 
2. Initiation: Pull the dumbbells up by driving your elbows back towards your hips, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together. 
3. Focus: The key is shoulder extension (pulling back) rather than pulling the weight too far forward or up towards your neck, which shifts focus away from the lats. 
4. Control: Slowly lower the weight back down, getting a full stretch in the lats before the next repetition. 
5. Benefit: Chest support eliminates lower back strain, allowing for maximal lat activation and heavier lifting without compromising form. [2, 3, 5]

## Pallof Press
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Pallof_Press
**search_query:** pallof press muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Pallof Press is an anti-rotation core exercise that primarily targets your obliques, transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, and glutes to prevent your torso from twisting, working isometrically to resist the band's pull. The key movement pattern is resisting spinal rotation, teaching your core to stabilize the spine, with secondary muscles like deltoids, triceps, lats, traps, rhomboids, and erector spinae acting as stabilizers to maintain a rigid, upright posture as you press out and return the band. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary Core: Obliques (internal & external), Transverse Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis (maintains core rigidity). 
• Stabilizers: Glutes (especially gluteus maximus), Erector Spinae, Lats, Scapular Stabilizers (traps, rhomboids). 
• Upper Body (Secondary): Deltoids, Triceps, Rotator Cuff muscles (shoulder stability). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Pattern: Anti-Rotation 

• Goal: To actively resist unwanted rotation of the trunk. 
• Action: You press the band/cable straight out from your chest (or higher, depending on variation) while your core muscles contract powerfully to prevent your body from turning towards the anchor point. 
• Key: Maintain a stable spine, keeping hips and shoulders aligned, avoiding arching your back or shrugging. 
• How it Works: The resistance band creates a rotational force, and your core muscles work isometrically (without changing length) to counteract it, building functional strength for real-world movements. [1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]  

Variations (Changing the Challenge) 

• Half-Kneeling: Easier, good for beginners. 
• Standing: Harder, requires more core and glute engagement. 
• Staggered Stance (Split Stance): Increases stability demand. 
• Overhead: Adds shoulder stability and challenges core bracing under load. [1, 5, 10, 12, 13]

## Side-Lying Clamshells
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Side-Lying_Clamshells
**search_query:** clamshell exercise muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Side-Lying Clamshell primarily targets the gluteus medius, responsible for hip abduction (lifting the knee out) and stabilization, with secondary activation of the gluteus maximus, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae (TFL) for hip rotation and stability, working the movement pattern of hip abduction with external rotation while keeping the pelvis still for core control. It's excellent for hip and lower back health, teaching proper glute engagement for walking, running, and preventing knee/back pain. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
Muscles Worked 

• Primary: Gluteus Medius (hip abductor, stabilizer) 
• Secondary: Gluteus Maximus, Gluteus Minimus, Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL) (hip stabilizers, rotators) 
• Core: External Obliques (for pelvic stability) [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]  

Movement Pattern 

1. Starting Position: Lie on your side with knees bent (around 45-60 degrees), feet stacked, and hips/shoulders aligned. 
2. Action (Hip Abduction & External Rotation): Keeping your heels together and hips stable (no rolling back), lift your top knee upward, opening your legs like a clamshell. 
3. Control: Exhale as you lift, focusing on the glute, and slowly lower back down, maintaining core engagement. 
4. Key Focus: Prevent your torso from rotating backward to ensure glute activation over momentum. [2, 7, 8, 9]  

Benefits & Purpose 

• Glute Activation: Teaches the glutes to fire correctly, improving squats and functional movement. 
• Injury Prevention: Strengthens stabilizing muscles around the hip, protecting the lower back and knees. 
• Rehabilitation: Used for hip/back injuries because it's low-impact and isolates key muscles. [1, 3, 5, 10, 11]

## Shoulder Dislocate
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Shoulder_Dislocate
**search_query:** shoulder dislocate muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The "shoulder dislocate" (or shoulder dislocates) mobility exercise works periscapular muscles (traps, serratus anterior) and rotator cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis) to improve overall shoulder range of motion (ROM) and stability, engaging scapular elevation, depression, protraction, retraction, and rotation through a wide overhead arc with straight arms, essential for joint health but should be avoided with active dislocations. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Muscles Worked 

• Rotator Cuff Muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537148/) (dynamic stabilizers). 
• Periscapular Muscles: Trapezius, Serratus Anterior (scapular movement). 
• Deltoids & Triceps: Assist in lifting and stabilizing the arm. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

Movement Patterns (Scapulohumeral Rhythm) 

• Elevation & Depression: Lifting the shoulder blade up and down. 
• Protraction & Retraction: Moving the shoulder blade forward and backward. 
• Rotation (Scapular): Tilting and rotating the shoulder blade. 
• Glenohumeral Movement: Full overhead flexion/extension and rotation as the humerus moves in the socket. [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]  

Key Points for the Exercise (with a dowel/band) 

• Goal: Lubricate the joint and move tissues through a full ROM. 
• Technique: Straight arms, moving hands from front to back in a controlled circular motion. 
• Caution: Stay within your comfortable range; avoid if you have a current injury or instability; consult a PT for rehab. [2, 7, 10]

## Scapular Pull-Up
**exercise_id:** CUSTOM:Scapular_Pull-Up
**search_query:** scapular pull-up muscles worked
**retrieved_at:** 

The Scapular Pull-Up targets your upper back and shoulders, primarily engaging the latissimus dorsi, trapezius (lower & middle), rhomboids, and serratus anterior, developing scapular depression and retraction (pulling shoulder blades down and together) with minimal arm involvement, essential for proper pull-up form and posture. The movement pattern involves initiating from a dead hang by depressing and retracting the scapulae to lift the body a few inches, focusing on the initial phase of a full pull-up to build foundational strength and control. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Primary Muscles Worked: 

• Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Aids in depressing the scapula. 
• Trapezius (Lower & Middle): Depresses (pulls down) and retracts (pulls back) the shoulder blades. 
• Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Assist in scapular retraction. 
• Serratus Anterior: Helps control scapular upward rotation and stability. [1, 6, 7]  

Secondary Muscles Worked: 

• Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Provide isometric stability for the trunk. 
• Posterior Deltoids: Assist in shoulder stabilization. 
• Forearms & Grip: Activated for hanging, though less dominant than in full pull-ups. [1, 4, 6]  

Movement Pattern: 

1. Start: Hang from a bar with straight arms (dead hang). 
2. Depress & Retract: Without bending your elbows, squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull them down, slightly lifting your body a few inches. 
3. Hold: Briefly pause at the top. 
4. Return: Slowly lower back to the dead hang position. [2, 4, 5]  

This exercise isolates the initial pulling action, teaching you to engage your back muscles before your biceps, preventing shoulder impingement and building strength for harder pull-up variations. [2, 4, 8]
