    "raw_text": "The Sandbag Good Morning is a hip-hinge movement that heavily targets your posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, lower back/erector spinae) for strength and mobility, forcing core stabilization, while the sandbag's shifting weight demands more coordination than a barbell, building functional strength in a natural, life-like motion. You push hips back, lower torso with a flat back, feeling a stretch in the hamstrings, then drive hips forward to stand, engaging glutes and hamstrings to lift. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \nMuscles Worked (Posterior Chain & Core) \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Hip Extension): Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus. \n\u2022 Stabilizers (Spinal Extension): Erector Spinae (lower back muscles). \n\u2022 Core/Stabilization: Abdominals and obliques work isometrically to maintain a rigid, neutral spine, preventing rounding. [2, 5, 8, 9]  \n\nMovement Pattern (Hip Hinge) \n\n1. Setup: Shoulder the sandbag, stand hip-width apart, chest up, shoulders back, knees slightly bent (not deep). \n2. Hinge (Eccentric Phase): Push your hips backward, allowing your chest to fall forward while maintaining a flat, neutral spine (like bowing). \n3. Depth: Lower until your torso is near parallel to the floor or you feel a deep stretch in your hamstrings. \n4. Return (Concentric Phase): Squeeze your glutes and hamstrings to drive your hips forward, returning to the starting upright position. [1, 2, 4, 6]  \n\nKey Takeaway \nThe sandbag's unstable nature recruits more stabilizing muscles and develops functional strength, mimicking real-world lifting patterns better than traditional weighted exercises.
