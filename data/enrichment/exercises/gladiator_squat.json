    "raw_text": "The \"Gladiator Squat\" is a dynamic kettlebell movement combining a bottoms-up goblet squat with a pullover transition into a back squat, working legs (quads, glutes, hamstrings, adductors) heavily, plus core, shoulders, grip, and back for stability, improving mobility, power, and coordination through hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension, and trunk stabilization patterns. [1, 2, 3]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: Quadriceps, Glutes (maximus), Hamstrings, Adductors (inner thighs). \n\u2022 Stabilizers & Support: Core (abdominals, spinal erectors), Shoulders (grip, control), Back. [1, 3, 4]  \n\nMovement Pattern \nThis complex, compound movement involves several phases: \n\n1. Bottoms-Up Goblet Squat: Kettlebell held upside-down (by horns) to deep squat, engaging legs and core. \n2. Pullover Transition: Standing up, pull the kettlebell overhead and onto the upper back. \n3. Back Squat: Perform a standard back squat with the kettlebell in place. \n4. Explosive Return: Drive up and smoothly return the kettlebell to the starting goblet position. [3]  \n\nKey Joint Actions \n\n\u2022 Eccentric Phase (Lowering): Hip flexion, knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion (bringing foot towards shin). \n\u2022 Concentric Phase (Lifting): Hip extension, knee extension, ankle plantarflexion (pointing toes). [2]  \n\nBenefits \n\n\u2022 Full-Body Strength & Power: Integrates lower body, core, and upper body. \n\u2022 Mobility & Stability: Enhances thoracic (upper back) mobility and shoulder stability. \n\u2022 Coordination: Builds functional strength through dynamic transitions.
