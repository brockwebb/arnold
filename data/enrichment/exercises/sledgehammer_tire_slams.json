    "raw_text": "Sledgehammer tire slams are a full-body power and conditioning exercise, engaging the shoulders, back (lats, traps), core (abs, obliques), arms (biceps, triceps), glutes, and legs (hamstrings, quads), working in a dynamic, explosive vertical/diagonal swinging motion that transfers power from the hips through the core and arms, improving functional strength, endurance, and coordination across multiple planes of motion. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \nThis video demonstrates how to perform a sledgehammer tire slam: \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Upper Body: Deltoids (shoulders), Traps, Lats, Biceps, Triceps, Forearms, Grip. \n\u2022 Core: Abdominals (abs) and Obliques. \n\u2022 Lower Body: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quads (especially in initiating the swing). [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Patterns & Key Mechanics \n\n1. Power Generation: The movement starts from the ground up, using the legs and hips to drive power, similar to a kettlebell swing or hang clean. \n2. Explosive Swing: A fluid, arc-like motion brings the hammer overhead, engaging the entire posterior chain and shoulders. \n3. Core Stabilization: The core rapidly stabilizes the torso as the weight moves overhead and drives down. \n4. Rotational Strength: Slams involve movement in multiple planes, enhancing rotational power, especially with variations like one-handed \"Tomahawks\" or diagonal swings. \n5. Full-Body Coordination: Requires synchronizing upper body, core, and lower body for efficient power transfer and impact absorption. [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]  \n\nYou can also watch this video to see the power of the tire slam: \nKey Benefits \n\n\u2022 Full-Body Conditioning: Works almost every muscle for overall strength and endurance. \n\u2022 Power & Explosiveness: Develops explosive power and athletic performance. \n\u2022 Muscular Endurance: Repetitive motion builds endurance in key areas. \n\u2022 Functional Strength: Mimics real-world power transfer needed in many sports.
