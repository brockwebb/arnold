    "raw_text": "Scap Push-Ups primarily target the Serratus Anterior (protraction) and Rhomboids (retraction) for shoulder blade stability, alongside the Traps, Pecs, and Core, using a movement pattern of scapular protraction (pushing shoulder blades apart) and retraction (squeezing them together) in a plank, focusing on shoulder movement without bending elbows to build shoulder health and posture. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: \n\n    \u2022 Serratus Anterior: Key for pushing shoulder blades away from the spine (protraction). \n    \u2022 Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Squeeze shoulder blades together (retraction). \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers & Synergists: \n\n    \u2022 Trapezius (Upper, Middle, Lower): Assists in elevation, depression, and stabilization. \n    \u2022 Pectoralis Minor: Helps with protraction. \n    \u2022 Levator Scapulae: Connects shoulder blade to neck, aids elevation. \n    \u2022 Core (Abs, Obliques): Keeps the body in a rigid plank. [1, 2, 3, 5]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Starting Position: High plank with hands under shoulders, elbows straight, body in a straight line. \n2. Protraction (Pushing Away): Push your upper body away from the floor by spreading your shoulder blades apart, rounding your upper back slightly; keep elbows locked. \n3. Retraction (Squeezing In): Allow your chest to sink towards the floor as you squeeze your shoulder blades together, bringing your body lower. \n4. Repetition: Smoothly transition between protraction and retraction, moving only the shoulder blades, not bending elbows or sagging the back.
