    "raw_text": "The Trap-Bar Row is a compound back exercise targeting the lats, rhomboids, traps (mid-back) for thickness and width, while also engaging rear delts, biceps, forearms, and the core for stability, making it great for overall upper back strength and grip. The movement pattern is a hip hinge with powerful elbow drive, focusing on pulling the bar towards the belly button while maintaining a flat back, challenging the posterior chain (glutes/hamstrings) isometrically. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nThis video demonstrates the muscle engagement during the trap bar row: \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Back): Latissimus Dorsi (lats), Rhomboids, Trapezius (mid/lower). \n\u2022 Secondary Movers (Pulling/Stabilizers): Rear Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms, Erector Spinae (lower back), Glutes/Hamstrings (isometric hold), Core (obliques, abs). [2, 3, 4]  \n\nYou can see a visual breakdown of the muscles worked in this video: \nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Setup: Stand inside the trap bar with feet hip-width apart, knees soft, hinging at the hips with a flat back (like a deadlift start). \n2. Grip: Grab the handles with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). \n3. Pull (Concentric): Drive your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull the bar towards your midsection. \n4. Hold: Briefly squeeze your back muscles at the top. \n5. Lower (Eccentric): Control the weight back down, extending your hips and maintaining a flat back, inhaling as you lower. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nThis video shows the step-by-step technique for performing the trap bar row: \nKey Technique Points \n\n\u2022 Flat Back: Essential to protect your lower back and effectively target the upper back. \n\u2022 Elbow Drive: Focus on pulling your elbows back, not just your hands. \n\u2022 Glute/Hamstring Engagement: Keep your posterior chain tight to support your torso. \n\u2022 Core Bracing: Engage your core to maintain spinal stability.
