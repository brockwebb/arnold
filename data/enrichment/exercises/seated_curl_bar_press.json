    "raw_text": "A Seated Curl-Bar Press (often called a Seated EZ-Bar Curl to Press) primarily targets the Biceps Brachii, Brachialis, and Forearms, with secondary involvement from Anterior Deltoids, combining elbow flexion (curling) with shoulder flexion/pressing. The movement pattern involves curling the bar up (like a standard bicep curl) and then continuing the upward motion to press it overhead, engaging shoulders at the top before slowly reversing the motion back down. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Biceps & Forearms): \n\n    \u2022 Biceps Brachii: The main muscle on the front of your upper arm, responsible for flexing the elbow. \n    \u2022 Brachialis: A deeper elbow flexor that pushes the biceps up, adding arm size. \n    \u2022 Brachioradialis: A forearm muscle that assists with elbow flexion, especially in the lower part of the curl. \n\n\u2022 Secondary/Stabilizers: \n\n    \u2022 Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Engaged as the movement transitions from a curl to an overhead press. \n    \u2022 Core/Glutes: Braced to stabilize the torso and prevent swinging. [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  \n\nThis video demonstrates the proper form for a seated curl-bar press: \nMovement Pattern: \n\n1. Starting Position: Sit on a bench, feet flat, holding the EZ-bar with an underhand grip (palms up or angled). \n2. The Curl Phase: Flex at the elbows, bringing the bar up towards your chest/nipple line, squeezing the biceps. \n3. The Press Phase (Transition): Continue the motion, pressing the bar overhead until your arms are extended. \n4. The Descent (Reverse): Control the weight as you lower it back to shoulder height (reverse of the press) and then continue lowering to the starting curl position, maintaining tension. \n5. Controlled Repetition: Perform in a smooth, controlled manner, avoiding momentum and focusing on the eccentric (lowering) phase for better muscle engagement. [2, 5, 6]  \n\nYou can also watch this video to learn how to perform the standard seated barbell curl: \nKey Considerations: \n\n\u2022 Grip: The EZ-bar's angles reduce wrist and elbow strain compared to a straight bar. \n\u2022 Focus: It combines bicep isolation with shoulder engagement, making it efficient but requiring control to avoid using momentum. \n\u2022 Weight: Start light to master the combined movement before increasing load.
