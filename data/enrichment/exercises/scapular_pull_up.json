    "raw_text": "The Scapular Pull-Up targets your upper back and shoulders, primarily engaging the latissimus dorsi, trapezius (lower & middle), rhomboids, and serratus anterior, developing scapular depression and retraction (pulling shoulder blades down and together) with minimal arm involvement, essential for proper pull-up form and posture. The movement pattern involves initiating from a dead hang by depressing and retracting the scapulae to lift the body a few inches, focusing on the initial phase of a full pull-up to build foundational strength and control. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nPrimary Muscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Aids in depressing the scapula. \n\u2022 Trapezius (Lower & Middle): Depresses (pulls down) and retracts (pulls back) the shoulder blades. \n\u2022 Rhomboids (Major & Minor): Assist in scapular retraction. \n\u2022 Serratus Anterior: Helps control scapular upward rotation and stability. [1, 6, 7]  \n\nSecondary Muscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Provide isometric stability for the trunk. \n\u2022 Posterior Deltoids: Assist in shoulder stabilization. \n\u2022 Forearms & Grip: Activated for hanging, though less dominant than in full pull-ups. [1, 4, 6]  \n\nMovement Pattern: \n\n1. Start: Hang from a bar with straight arms (dead hang). \n2. Depress & Retract: Without bending your elbows, squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull them down, slightly lifting your body a few inches. \n3. Hold: Briefly pause at the top. \n4. Return: Slowly lower back to the dead hang position. [2, 4, 5]  \n\nThis exercise isolates the initial pulling action, teaching you to engage your back muscles before your biceps, preventing shoulder impingement and building strength for harder pull-up variations.
