    "raw_text": "A Weighted Dead Hang is an isometric exercise primarily strengthening your grip (forearms/hands), back (lats, traps, rhomboids), and shoulders (deltoids, rotator cuff), while intensely engaging your core (abs, obliques) for stability, with spinal decompression as a major benefit, working muscles isometrically to build endurance and functional strength, not through traditional movement patterns. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Grip & Arms: Forearm flexors, hand muscles, wrist flexors. \n\u2022 Back: Latissimus dorsi (lats), trapezius (traps), rhomboids. \n\u2022 Shoulders: Deltoids, rotator cuff muscles, serratus anterior. \n\u2022 Core: Rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, erector spinae (deep stabilizers). \n\u2022 Legs (Stabilizers): Glutes, quads. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n\u2022 Isometric Contraction: Muscles are held under tension without changing length, focusing on stabilization rather than movement. \n\u2022 Scapular Stability: Teaches shoulder blades to depress and retract, stabilizing the shoulder girdle. \n\u2022 Spinal Decompression: Gravity lengthens the spine, creating space between vertebrae. [1, 3, 4, 9, 10]  \n\nHow It Works \n\n\u2022 Grip Strength: Holding the weight significantly increases the demand on your hands and forearms. \n\u2022 Core Stability: Your core works hard to prevent your body from swinging and maintain alignment. \n\u2022 Full-Body Tension: Creates full-body tension, especially in the upper back, shoulders, and arms, improving posture and upper body endurance.
