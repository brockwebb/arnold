    "raw_text": "The Push-Up with Sandbag Drag is a compound, full-body exercise that blends pushing (chest, shoulders, triceps) with anti-rotation and core stabilization (abs, obliques, lower back) and hip/leg engagement (glutes, hamstrings) to build power, core strength, and stability, progressing towards single-arm push-ups by challenging the body to maintain a rigid plank while shifting load laterally. It combines a standard push-up (pushing pattern) with a plank lateral drag (stabilization/anti-rotation pattern), targeting chest, shoulders, triceps, core, lats, and hips. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Pushing): Chest (Pectorals), Shoulders (Deltoids), Triceps. \n\u2022 Stabilizers/Core: Core (Transverse Abdominis, Obliques), Lower Back, Serratus Anterior. \n\u2022 Dynamic Stabilizers (Drag): Glutes, Hamstrings, Lats, Forearms (for grip). [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nThis video demonstrates how to perform a sandbag lateral drag: \nMovement Patterns \n\n\u2022 Pushing: The standard push-up portion involves elbow flexion and extension (pushing) to move the body up and down. \n\u2022 Anti-Rotation/Stabilization: The drag requires significant anti-rotation, where the core and supporting shoulder/hip resist the bag's shifting weight, preventing hip or torso rotation. \n\u2022 Pulling/Scapular Movement (Drag): Reaching and pulling the bag engages the lats and challenges shoulder stability. \n\u2022 Full-Body Integration: Connects the core to the limbs, building functional strength for real-life movements by training the body to move as a unit, notes BrickHouse Nutrition (https://brickhousenutrition.com/blogs/articles/sandbag-training-101-is-this-the-ultimate-full-body-workout-tool) and Ultimate Sandbag Training (https://ultimatesandbagtraining.com/10-ultimate-sandbag-exercises-that-are-musts/). [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]  \n\nThis video shows a variation of the exercise with a dumbbell: \nHow It Works (The Drag) \n\n1. Start: Begin in a high plank with your feet wide and the sandbag beside one hand. \n2. Reach & Drag: Reach across your body with the opposite hand, grab the bag, and slowly drag it under your torso to the other side, keeping hips level and core tight. \n3. Push-Up: As the bag crosses, lower into a one-arm push-up, then press back up, maintaining tension. \n4. Alternate: Repeat the drag and push-up on the other side, creating a powerful, unstable workout.
