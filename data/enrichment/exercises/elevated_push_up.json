    "raw_text": "An elevated push-up (incline push-up) works the chest (pectorals), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps as primary movers, while engaging core, serratus anterior, and rotator cuff muscles for stabilization, using a pressing movement pattern (pushing away from an elevated surface) that reduces load but still strengthens these upper body muscles. [1, 2, 3]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: \n\n    \u2022 Pectoralis Major (Chest): Brings arms toward the body as you lower and pushes them away. \n    \u2022 Anterior Deltoids (Front Shoulders): Lift the upper arm forward and help press up. \n    \u2022 Triceps Brachii (Back of Arms): Straighten the elbow to extend the arms. \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers/Secondary Muscles: \n\n    \u2022 Core (Abs, Obliques): Keeps the body in a straight line, preventing sagging. \n    \u2022 Serratus Anterior & Trapezius: Support shoulder blade movement and stability. \n    \u2022 Rotator Cuff: Stabilizes the shoulder joint. \n    \u2022 Glutes & Quads: Contract to keep hips and legs aligned. [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Pattern (Incline Press) \n\n1. Starting Position: Hands on an elevated surface (bench, step), body in a straight line from head to heels, core engaged, glutes squeezed. \n2. Descent (Eccentric Phase): Slowly bend elbows, lowering your chest toward the elevated surface, keeping your body tight. \n3. Ascent (Concentric Phase): Press powerfully through your hands, extending your elbows to return to the starting position. \n4. Movement Type: A closed-chain, horizontal pressing movement that's a variation of the standard push-up, making it easier by reducing body weight resistance.
