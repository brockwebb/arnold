    "raw_text": "The Cat-Cow stretch (Bitilasana Marjaryasana) is a spinal mobility flow that works the core, back (erector spinae, traps, rhomboids), neck, shoulders, hip flexors, and glutes, improving spinal flexion/extension, core stability, and posture through alternating spinal rounding (Cat) and arching (Cow) movements, linking breath with movement for a full-body stretch and warm-up. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMovement Patterns & Muscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Starting Position (Tabletop): Hands under shoulders, knees under hips, spine neutral. \n\u2022 Cow Pose (Inhale): \n\n    \u2022 Action: Drop belly, lift tailbone and gaze forward/up. \n    \u2022 Muscles: Stretches abdominals, engages spinal erectors (back extensors) and glutes slightly to lift tailbone. \n\n\u2022 Cat Pose (Exhale): \n\n    \u2022 Action: Round spine towards ceiling, tuck chin/tailbone, pull belly in. \n    \u2022 Muscles: Engages abdominals (rectus abdominis, obliques), stretches back, neck (traps), and chest. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nKey Muscle Groups Activated \n\n\u2022 Spinal Muscles: Erector spinae, multifidus, trapezius (upper back). \n\u2022 Core: Rectus abdominis, obliques, transverse abdominis (deep core). \n\u2022 Shoulders & Neck: Deltoids, trapezius, deep neck muscles. \n\u2022 Hips: Gluteal muscles, iliopsoas (hip flexors). \n\u2022 Pelvic Floor: Engages with tailbone movement. [2, 4, 6, 8, 9]  \n\nBenefits & Purpose \n\n\u2022 Increases spinal mobility (flexion & extension). \n\u2022 Warms up & mobilizes the spine, great for daily movement or workouts. \n\u2022 Relieves back and neck tension. \n\u2022 Improves posture & core stability. \n\u2022 Stretches the chest, hips, abdomen, and back.
