    "raw_text": "The Kettlebell (KB) V-Sit Pass-Over (also known as a V-sit with pass the weight, or a variation of a kettlebell figure-eight in a V-sit) is a demanding core exercise that primarily engages your abdominal muscles and hip flexors through controlled rotation and stability. [1, 2]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary: \n\n    \u2022 Rectus Abdominis: The \"six-pack\" muscles are heavily engaged to maintain the V-sit position and stabilize the torso. \n    \u2022 Obliques (External and Internal): These muscles are targeted as you twist and pass the kettlebell from side to side, controlling the rotational movement. \n    \u2022 Hip Flexors: These muscles work hard to keep your legs elevated and maintain the \"V\" shape. \n    \u2022 Transverse Abdominis: The deep core muscles act as stabilizers to protect the spine and maintain balance throughout the movement. \n\n\u2022 Secondary/Stabilizers: \n\n    \u2022 Erector Spinae: These lower back muscles help maintain an upright posture and prevent the back from rounding. \n    \u2022 Shoulders and Arms: The muscles in your shoulders, biceps, triceps, and forearms are engaged to hold and control the kettlebell, improving grip strength and shoulder stability. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Patterns \nThe KB V-Sit Pass-Over incorporates several functional movement patterns: \n\n\u2022 Trunk Rotation/Anti-Rotation: The core must stabilize the body while the upper body rotates to pass the weight, building core control and strength. \n\u2022 Core Stabilization: The exercise requires significant isometric strength to hold the V-sit position and resist the force of the moving kettlebell trying to pull you off balance. \n\u2022 Flexion/Extension Control: Maintaining the balance in the V-sit requires continuous control over the flexion of the hips and stabilization of the spine. \n\u2022 Coordination and Balance: The dynamic nature of passing the kettlebell around and between the legs challenges balance and hand-eye coordination.
