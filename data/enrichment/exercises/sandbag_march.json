    "raw_text": "The Sandbag March is a dynamic exercise that builds functional strength, targeting your legs (quads, glutes, hamstrings), core (abs, obliques, lower back) for stability, and upper back/shoulders to maintain posture, working through the locomotion/marching movement pattern to improve balance, coordination, and endurance, mimicking real-world movement. It's excellent for training your body to move as an integrated system, unlike static exercises. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Legs): Glutes, Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Hip Flexors. \n\u2022 Core (Stabilizers): Abdominals, Obliques, Erector Spinae (lower back). \n\u2022 Upper Body (Stabilizers): Upper Back (Rhomboids, Traps), Rear Deltoids, Lats (to keep the bag tight). [1, 2, 3, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Patterns & Benefits \n\n\u2022 Locomotion: It's a fundamental walking pattern, enhancing balance and preventing shuffling. \n\u2022 Dynamic Stability: The unstable nature of the sandbag forces deep core engagement to prevent swaying, improving anti-rotation and anti-extension. \n\u2022 Single-Leg Strength: It trains single-leg stability and coordination, crucial for walking, running, and reducing fall risk. \n\u2022 Posterior Chain Activation: Works the glutes and hamstrings together, vital for power and stability. \n\u2022 Full-Body Integration: Connects upper body tension (pulling handles apart) with lower body movement, building resilient, connected strength. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]  \n\nHow It Works (Bear Hug Carry Example) \n\n1. Grab the Sandbag: Bear-hug it tightly to your chest for maximum core/upper back engagement. \n2. March: Lift one knee high (engaging hip flexors) while keeping your torso tall and stable. \n3. Maintain Tension: \"Pull\" the handles apart to keep the upper back engaged and prevent rounding. \n4. Coordinate: Your core and glutes work together to stabilize your pelvis and body as you move through single-leg stances.
