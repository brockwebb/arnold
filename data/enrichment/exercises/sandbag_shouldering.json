    "raw_text": "Sandbag Shouldering is a full-body, functional movement targeting legs (glutes, hamstrings), hips, core (abs, lower back, obliques), shoulders, traps, and arms (biceps/forearms) by lifting a shifting load from the ground to the shoulder, emphasizing explosive hip power, core stability, and grip strength through a dynamic hip hinge and upward drive, mimicking real-world lifting. The pattern involves a deadlift-like pull, transitioning to a powerful hip extension (like a front squat/leg press), and finishing with a shoulder stabilization, building total-body coordination.\n\nMuscles Worked\n* Legs: Glutes, Hamstrings, Quadriceps (especially during the drive up).\n* Hips & Core: Hip extensors, Abdominals, Obliques, Lower Back (erector spinae) for stability.\n* Back: Upper Back (traps, rhomboids) for stabilization and pulling.\n* Shoulders & Arms: Deltoids, Biceps, Forearms (grip).\n\nMovement Pattern (Ground-to-Shoulder)\n1. Setup: Stand over the sandbag with feet shoulder-width apart, hips hinged back, chest up, and a firm grip on the bag.\n2. First Pull (Deadlift): Pull the bag into your lap, keeping your back straight, similar to a deadlift, focusing on hip hinge.\n3. Second Pull (Explosion): From the lap, explode upwards by driving your hips forward and extending your legs (like a front squat/leg press).\n4. Shoulder Transfer: As you drive up, use your hips and torso to launch the bag upward, catching it on your shoulder, stabilizing with the opposite hand.\n5. Stabilization: Brace your core and hold the bag securely on the shoulder.\n\nKey Concepts\n* Full-Body Integration: It's not just arms or legs; the whole body works together.\n* Hip Hinge Foundation: Strong hip hinge mobility and strength are crucial for getting the bag to the lap.\n* Unstable Load: The shifting weight constantly challenges core stabilizers (abs, obliques, lower back).\n* Power Development: Builds explosive power through the hips and posterior chain.\n* Functional Strength: Mimics real-world lifting and carrying.",
