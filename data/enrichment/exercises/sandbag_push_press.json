    "raw_text": "The Sandbag Push Press is a full-body power movement engaging legs (glutes, quads, calves), core (abs, obliques, spinal erectors), shoulders (deltoids), upper back (traps, lats), and arms (triceps) for a dynamic overhead press, using a slight dip and drive to generate force, making it highly functional for athletic power and stability due to the shifting weight, notes Dingo Sandbags (https://www.dingosandbags.com.au/frequently-asked-questions/sandbag-overhead-press/), CrossFit (https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-push-press), SET FOR SET (https://www.setforset.com/blogs/news/push-press), and MIKOLO (https://gym-mikolo.com/blogs/home-gym/push-press-muscles-worked-and-benefits). The shifting sandbag demands increased core and shoulder stabilizer activation for balance and coordination, unlike a stable barbell. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Legs: Glutes, Quadriceps (Vastus Medialis, Lateralis, Intermedius, Rectus Femoris), Hamstrings, Calves. \n\u2022 Core: Abdominals (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis), Spinal Erectors. \n\u2022 Shoulders: Deltoids (Anterior, Lateral, Posterior). \n\u2022 Upper Back: Trapezius (Traps), Latissimus Dorsi (Lats). \n\u2022 Arms: Triceps (for lockout). \n\u2022 Chest: Pectorals (assists pressing). [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Starting Position: Hold the sandbag at shoulder height (the \"rack\" position). \n2. Dip Phase: Perform a quick, shallow squat by bending at the hips, knees, and ankles, keeping your torso upright. \n3. Drive Phase: Explosively extend your hips, knees, and ankles (like jumping) to generate upward momentum. \n4. Press Phase: As you extend your legs, press the sandbag overhead with your arms, locking out your elbows at the top. \n5. Catch/Finish: Receive the weight in a stable overhead position, then return it to the rack or the floor. [3, 4, 8, 9, 10]  \n\nKey Aspect (Sandbag) \n\n\u2022 Shifting Load: The unstable nature of the sandbag forces deep engagement of core stabilizers and shoulder girdle muscles (medial/posterior delts, traps) to control the weight, enhancing functional strength and coordination.
