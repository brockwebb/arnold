    "raw_text": "A Tucked Hang (or Hanging Knee Tuck) primarily targets your core (abs, obliques), hip flexors, and grip strength (forearms), while also engaging the lats and upper back for stability; the movement pattern involves a controlled lift of the knees to the chest (hip flexion/spinal flexion) from a dead hang, requiring isometric strength and control to prevent swinging. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary: \n\n    \u2022 Rectus Abdominis & Transverse Abdominis: For spinal flexion and core bracing. \n    \u2022 Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas): To bring the knees up. \n    \u2022 Forearms: For grip endurance. \n\n\u2022 Secondary/Stabilizers: \n\n    \u2022 Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Engage to keep the body stable and control the descent. \n    \u2022 Obliques: For rotational stability (especially in twisting variations) and core bracing. \n    \u2022 Scapular Stabilizers (Rhomboids, Traps): To keep shoulders down and packed. \n    \u2022 Biceps: Isometrically to stabilize the arms. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Patterns \n\n1. Start: Begin in a full dead hang, gripping the bar with palms facing forward (or neutral grip for more lat activation). \n2. Engage: Pull your shoulder blades down (scapular depression) and brace your core, tucking your pelvis slightly. \n3. Lift (Hip & Spinal Flexion): Drive your knees up towards your chest (thighs parallel to the floor or higher), bending at the hips and flexing the spine. \n4. Control: Lower back down slowly and with resistance, preventing your body from swinging like a pendulum. \n5. Core Focus: Think about rounding your spine and bringing your pelvis to your ribs, rather than just pulling with your legs. [1, 2, 3, 6, 9]  \n\nThis exercise is excellent for building foundational core and grip strength needed for more advanced calisthenics like L-sits and front levers.
