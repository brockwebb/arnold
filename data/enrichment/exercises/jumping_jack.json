    "raw_text": "Jumping jacks are a full-body cardio exercise engaging calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes (lower body), deltoids, and shoulder muscles (upper body) for propulsion and arm movement, alongside core and hip stabilizers; the movement pattern involves rhythmic jumping (hip/knee/ankle extension) and arm abduction/adduction (raising/lowering arms), requiring coordination and working as a plyometric warm-up or conditioning exercise. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Lower Body: Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus), Quadriceps (vastus muscles), Hamstrings, Glutes. \n\u2022 Upper Body: Shoulders (deltoids, supraspinatus), Arms (biceps/triceps stabilize). \n\u2022 Core & Hips: Core muscles, Hip abductors, Hip flexors for stability and movement control. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Patterns (Phases): \n\n1. Starting Position: Standing with feet together, arms at sides. \n2. Upward/Outward (Propel/Abduction): \n\n    \u2022 Jumping feet out wide (hip and knee extension). \n    \u2022 Swinging arms overhead (shoulder abduction). \n\n3. Middle Position (Peak): Feet wide, arms overhead, body engaged. \n4. Downward/Inward (Return/Adduction): \n\n    \u2022 Jumping feet back together (hip and knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion for landing). \n    \u2022 Bringing arms back down to sides (shoulder adduction). \n\n5. Rhythm: This cycle repeats continuously, making it a great plyometric and cardiovascular exercise.
