    "raw_text": "[The Plank with Weighted Reach-Through is a dynamic core exercise strengthening your abs, obliques, shoulders, and back, challenging anti-rotation stability, balance, and overall core strength by dragging a dumbbell under your body from a high plank, requiring hip and torso stillness while moving the weight across your midline. [1, 2, 3]  \nMuscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Primary: Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transversus Abdominis (deep core). \n\u2022 Secondary: Shoulders (Deltoids), Upper Back (Lats, Traps), Glutes, Hip Flexors, Lower Back. [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  \n\nMovement Pattern: \n\n1. Starting Position: High plank (push-up position) with a dumbbell just outside one hand, body in a straight line from head to heels, core engaged. \n2. Reach & Drag: Reach with your opposite hand, grab the dumbbell, and drag it under your body to the other side. \n3. Stabilize: Maintain a strong plank; hips should stay level, avoiding excessive rocking or lifting. \n4. Return & Switch: Place the dumbbell down, return to the starting plank, then repeat on the other side, alternating hands. \n5. Focus: The movement emphasizes anti-rotation, forcing your core to work hard to prevent your hips and torso from twisting as the weight moves.
