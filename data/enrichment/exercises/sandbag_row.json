    "raw_text": "The Sandbag Row (Bent-Over) is a compound pulling movement targeting the upper back (traps, rhomboids, lats), with significant assistance from the biceps, forearms (grip strength), and shoulders, while the core, glutes, and hamstrings stabilize the whole body due to the shifting weight, building functional strength and improving posture. Its primary pattern is a hip hinge (like a deadlift) combined with a pulling/rowing motion, challenging stabilizer muscles more than rigid weights. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Pulling): \n\n    \u2022 Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): For pulling the bag towards the body. \n    \u2022 Trapezius (Traps): Mid and upper traps for shoulder blade retraction. \n    \u2022 Rhomboids: Between shoulder blades, crucial for scapular stability. \n\n\u2022 Assisting Muscles: \n\n    \u2022 Biceps & Forearms: For elbow flexion and intense grip strength due to the unstable load. \n    \u2022 Posterior Deltoids (Rear Shoulders): Help with pulling and stabilization. \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers (Core & Lower Body): \n\n    \u2022 Core (Abs, Obliques, Erectors): To prevent torso rotation and maintain a rigid spine. \n    \u2022 Glutes & Hamstrings: To support the hip hinge and keep the lower body stable. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \n\nMovement Patterns \n\n1. Hip Hinge: Bending at the hips with a slight knee bend, similar to a Romanian Deadlift (RDL), to pick up the bag. \n2. Pull/Row: Driving the elbows back and squeezing shoulder blades together to pull the bag to the torso. \n3. Scapular Control: Actively retracting and controlling the shoulder blades due to the sandbag's shifting weight, enhancing stability. \n4. Core Engagement: Constant tension to keep the torso stable and prevent rounding, making it a full-body functional movement. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  \n\nKey Benefits \n\n\u2022 Functional Strength: Mimics lifting awkward, real-world objects. \n\u2022 Enhanced Grip: Demands significant hand and forearm strength. \n\u2022 Improved Posture: Strengthens upper back and scapular stabilizers. \n\u2022 Core Stability: Forces intense core activation.
