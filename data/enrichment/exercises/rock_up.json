    "raw_text": "The \"rock-up\" movement is an explosive vertical pull transitioning into a vertical/horizontal push movement pattern, commonly known as a muscle-up. This bodyweight exercise is a complex, compound movement that works numerous muscles across the entire body. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \nThe rock-up (muscle-up) primarily engages the following muscle groups: [5]  \nPrimary Movers \u2022 Back: The latissimus dorsi (lats) are the main pulling muscles, essential for the initial explosive pull upward. \n\u2022 Arms: \n\n    \u2022 Biceps brachii are heavily involved in the pulling phase. \n    \u2022 Triceps brachii are the primary movers during the \"up\" (dipping/pushing) phase to lock out the arms over the bar. \n    \u2022 Forearms and hand intrinsic muscles are constantly engaged to maintain a strong grip. \n\n\u2022 Shoulders: The deltoids (front, middle, and rear) are crucial for stability and moving the arms throughout the range of motion. \n\u2022 Chest: The pectoralis major assists in the transition and pushing phase. \n\u2022 Core: The rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis stabilize the spine and transfer force between the upper and lower body, especially during the dynamic transition. [1, 3, 4]  \n\nStabilizer Muscles \u2022 Upper Back: The trapezius and rhomboids stabilize the scapula (shoulder blades) throughout the entire movement. \n\u2022 Serratus Anterior: Important for scapular stability and upward rotation during the reach and push phases. [1, 3, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Patterns \nThe rock-up combines two fundamental movement patterns: \n\n\u2022 Vertical Pulling: The initial phase involves pulling the body up toward the bar, similar to a pull-up. \n\u2022 Vertical Pushing: The second phase involves pushing the body up and over the bar, finishing in a straight-arm support position, similar to a straight-bar dip. [3, 4]  \n\nThe full movement is a dynamic, explosive action that requires significant coordination, strength, and power to smoothly transition from the pull to the push.
