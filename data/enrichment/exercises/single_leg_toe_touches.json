    "raw_text": "Single-Leg Toe Touches primarily target the hamstrings, glutes, and core (abs), while improving balance, stability, and hip mobility through a hip-hinge pattern, working muscles dynamically for stretching and strengthening, especially the posterior chain and stabilizers, and enhancing proprioception for better body awareness. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) \n\n\u2022 Hamstrings: (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus) \u2013 Key muscles for stretching and eccentric control. \n\u2022 Glutes: (Gluteus Maximus) \u2013 Activates to help drive you back up and stabilize the hip. \n\u2022 Core: (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis) \u2013 Stabilizes the torso and prevents excessive spinal rounding. \n\u2022 Calves & Ankles: Act as stabilizers during the single-leg stance. \n\u2022 Lower Back: (Spinal Erectors) \u2013 Involved in maintaining spinal posture during the hinge. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Starting Position: Stand on one leg, keeping a slight bend in the supporting knee; the other leg is lifted behind you. \n2. The Hinge: Hinge forward at the hip (not by rounding the spine), reaching the opposite hand towards the floor or your standing foot. \n3. Dynamic Stretch: Feel the stretch in the hamstring of the standing leg and the glute/lower back of the lifted leg. \n4. Return: Drive through the glute and hamstring to return to the starting position, squeezing at the top. \n5. Balance Focus: The movement emphasizes controlling the descent and ascent, challenging balance and motor control. [1, 3, 6, 9, 10]  \n\nBenefits \n\n\u2022 Dynamic Warm-Up: Great for preparing for sports and lifting. \n\u2022 Improves Balance & Proprioception: Enhances body awareness and joint stability. \n\u2022 Strengthens Posterior Chain: Activates hamstrings, glutes, and core. \n\u2022 Increases Flexibility: Stretches hamstrings and hips. \n\u2022 Injury Prevention: Strengthens stabilizing muscles around the knee, ankle, and hip.
