    "raw_text": "Side Plank Crunches primarily target your obliques (internal & external) for spinal lateral flexion, engaging your entire core (transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis) for stability, along with glutes and hips for pelvic alignment, while the movement pattern involves a dynamic side bend and crunch from a stable side plank base, building core endurance and waistline strength. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: \n\n    \u2022 Obliques (Internal & External): The star muscles, responsible for the side bending (lateral flexion) and twisting motion of the trunk. \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers & Secondary Muscles: \n\n    \u2022 Transversus Abdominis (TVA): Deep core muscle for overall spinal stability. \n    \u2022 Rectus Abdominis: The \"six-pack\" muscle, offers some activation during the crunch. \n    \u2022 Glutes (Maximus, Medius, Minimus): Stabilize the pelvis and hips, preventing sagging. \n    \u2022 Quadratus Lumborum (QL): Deep lower back muscle aiding spinal stabilization. \n    \u2022 Shoulder Stabilizers & Hip Muscles: Keep the upper body and lower body aligned. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Starting Position (Static Plank): Lie on your side, elbow under shoulder, legs stacked, body in a straight line, engaging core and glutes. \n2. Dynamic Crunch (Flexion): Bring the top knee towards the chest while simultaneously bringing the top elbow towards the knee, creating a crunching motion. \n3. Extension: Return to the straight, extended side plank position. \n4. Focus: The movement is a controlled side bend and spinal flexion, engaging the obliques to pull the rib cage toward the hip.
