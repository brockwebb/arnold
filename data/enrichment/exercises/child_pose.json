    "raw_text": "Child's Pose (Balasana) primarily stretches the spine, hips, and thighs, working muscles like the lower back (erector spinae), glutes, hip flexors, lats, and shoulders, while providing a restorative and calming forward fold that activates the parasympathetic nervous system for relaxation, improving mobility and relieving tension. Its movement pattern involves spinal flexion and hip flexion, creating a gentle decompression. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \nMuscles Worked & Stretched \n\n\u2022 Lower Back (Erector Spinae): Gently stretches and decompresses the lumbar spine. \n\u2022 Glutes (Buttocks): Stretches the gluteal muscles, relieving hip tension. \n\u2022 Hip Flexors: Stretches the front of the thighs. \n\u2022 Shoulders (Teres Major, Latissimus Dorsi): Stretches when arms are extended forward, improving mobility. \n\u2022 Thighs/Quads: Stretches the front of the thighs. \n\u2022 Ankles & Feet: Mild stretch from the tucked position. \n\u2022 Obliques & Core: Gentle engagement supports spinal movement. [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9]  \n\nMovement Pattern & Benefits \n\n\u2022 Type: A forward fold and restorative pose. \n\u2022 Spinal Movement: Lower spine flexes (rounds), upper spine extends slightly, promoting decompression. \n\u2022 Hip Movement: Hip flexion (folding hips towards thighs). \n\u2022 Nervous System: Stimulates the vagus nerve through forehead support and deep breathing, activating the relaxation response (parasympathetic nervous system). \n\u2022 Purpose: Rest, stress relief, back pain relief, improved mobility, and a moment to reset.
