    "raw_text": "The Bird-Dog exercise targets the deep core (transverse abdominis, obliques, rectus abdominis), spinal extensors (erector spinae), glutes, hamstrings, and upper back/shoulders (traps, deltoids, lats) for spinal stability, balance, and coordination, working by extending the opposite arm and leg from a quadruped (all-fours) position to build functional strength and improve posture. The movement pattern involves slow, controlled anti-rotation and extension, emphasizing neutral spine and resisting hip/shoulder shifting. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Core: Transverse Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis, Obliques (for stability). \n\u2022 Back: Erector Spinae (along the spine), Trapezius, Latissimus Dorsi (upper back). \n\u2022 Glutes: Gluteus Maximus, Medius, Minimus (buttock muscles). \n\u2022 Shoulders: Deltoids (front), Pectoralis (chest) (stabilizers). \n\u2022 Legs: Hamstrings (back of thigh). [3, 4, 6, 8, 9]  \n\nMovement Pattern (Functional Movement) \n\n\u2022 Starting Position: All fours (hands under shoulders, knees under hips). \n\u2022 Action: Extend one arm forward and the opposite leg straight back, keeping them in line with the torso. \n\u2022 Key Focus: Maintain a neutral spine (avoid arching or rounding), keep hips and shoulders level, and reach long through fingertips and toes. \n\u2022 Return: Slowly return to the start and alternate sides. \n\u2022 Pattern Type: An anti-rotation, contralateral (opposite limbs) movement that promotes spinal stability and functional core strength for daily tasks and sports.
