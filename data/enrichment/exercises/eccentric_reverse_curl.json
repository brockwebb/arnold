    "raw_text": "The Eccentric Reverse Curl primarily targets forearm muscles like the Brachioradialis and Brachialis, plus the Biceps Brachii, with a focus on the lowering phase (eccentric) for strength and control, using an overhand (pronated) grip for elbow flexion, strengthening grip, and building overall arm mass and definition, requiring core stability for proper form. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked: \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: \n\n    \u2022 Brachioradialis: The main forearm muscle, highly activated by the pronated grip, assists in elbow flexion and wrist rotation. \n    \u2022 Brachialis: Sits under the biceps and is a powerful elbow flexor, pushing the biceps up as it develops. \n\n\u2022 Secondary Muscles: \n\n    \u2022 Biceps Brachii: Still involved in elbow flexion, but the forearm muscles take precedence with the overhand grip. \n    \u2022 Core & Upper Back: Isometrically contract to keep your torso stable and upright. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nMovement Pattern (Eccentric Focus): \n\n1. Starting Position: Stand or sit holding a barbell or dumbbells with an overhand (palms facing down) grip, hands shoulder-width apart. \n2. Concentric (Lifting Phase - Optional): Flex your elbows to curl the weight towards your shoulders, squeezing the muscles. \n3. Eccentric (Lowering Phase - The Focus): Slowly and with control, lower the weight back to the starting position, resisting gravity as the forearm muscles lengthen under tension. \n4. Key Technique: Keep elbows tucked in, wrists straight, and control the entire range of motion for maximum muscle engagement and to prevent injury. [3, 4, 8, 9, 10]  \n\nWhy Eccentric? \n\n\u2022 Focusing on the eccentric (lowering) phase builds strength, muscle size (hypertrophy), and improves control, making it great for preventing injuries and enhancing overall arm development, say experts at PureGym (https://www.puregym.com/exercises/arms-and-shoulders/bicep-curl/pronated-bicep-curls/) and Speediance (https://www.speediance.com/blogs/fitness/how-to-do-reverse-curls).
