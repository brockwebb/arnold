    "raw_text": "An Overhead Keg Walk (or similar overhead carry/lunge) works shoulder stability, core bracing, glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves, and upper back, combining loaded carry, lunge, and overhead stabilization patterns, focusing on anti-rotation and unilateral strength for overall stability and endurance. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: Deltoids (shoulders), Traps, Rhomboids, Lats (upper back), Glutes, Quadriceps, Triceps. \n\u2022 Stabilizers: Core (Transverse Abdominis, Obliques), Erector Spinae (lower back), Rotator Cuff, Calves, Hamstrings. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \n\nMovement Patterns Engaged \n\n\u2022 Loaded Carry: Holding weight overhead challenges shoulder and trunk stability, preventing collapse. \n\u2022 Lunge (Unilateral): Alternating legs builds balance and strength in each leg, targeting quads, glutes, and hamstrings. \n\u2022 Overhead Stability/Push: The act of holding the weight overhead engages the entire shoulder girdle and upper back to keep the weight stacked. \n\u2022 Core Bracing: Requires deep core engagement (abs and obliques) to prevent the spine from arching or rotating, especially with one leg moving. \n\u2022 Glute/Hamstring Engagement: Critical for stability in the standing leg and power during the lunge step. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nKey Takeaways \n\n\u2022 Integration: It's a full-body exercise, integrating lower body power (lunge) with upper body stability (overhead hold) and core control. \n\u2022 Balance & Coordination: Excellent for improving unilateral strength and coordination, as noted in GarageGymReviews.com (https://www.garagegymreviews.com/fundamental-movement-patterns) and Impulse Chiropractic and Rehab (https://impulsechiropractic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Guide-to-the-7-Functional-Movements.pdf). \n\u2022 Stabilization: Particularly useful for strengthening the shoulder joint and core, as explained in Body Glide (https://bodyglide.com/blog/6-essential-functional-movements/) and Hertfordshire Sports Village (https://www.hertssportsvillage.co.uk/news-exercise-of-the-month-waiters-carrywalk-1370).
