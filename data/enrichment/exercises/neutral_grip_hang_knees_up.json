    "raw_text": "The Neutral-Grip Hang Knees-Up targets your abs (rectus abdominis, obliques), hip flexors, and builds grip/forearm strength, with your lats, shoulders, and serratus anterior stabilizing isometrically; the movement pattern involves controlled hip and spinal flexion (pulling knees up) while resisting momentum and arching the back, promoting full-body stability and core power through a functional, full-range motion. [1, 2, 3]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Core): \n\n    \u2022 Rectus Abdominis: The \"six-pack\" muscle, responsible for spinal flexion (bringing torso towards legs). \n    \u2022 Obliques (Internal & External): Stabilize the torso and resist rotation, crucial for core stability. \n    \u2022 Hip Flexors (Iliopsoas): Lift the knees toward the chest. \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers & Support: \n\n    \u2022 Forearms & Hands: Maintain grip on the bar. \n    \u2022 Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): Engage to keep the body stable and prevent swinging. \n    \u2022 Serratus Anterior: Assists in shoulder girdle stability. \n    \u2022 Glutes & Lower Back: Engage to prevent arching and maintain a hollow body. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \n\nMovement Pattern & Technique \n\n1. Starting Position (Active Hang): Hang from the bar with palms facing each other (neutral grip), shoulders engaged (not slumped), and feet off the floor, creating a stable \"hollow body\" position. \n2. Concentric (Upward) Phase: Exhale as you initiate the movement by flexing your hips and spine, driving your knees up towards your chest, aiming for 90 degrees at the hips. \n3. Peak Contraction: Squeeze your abs at the top; the higher you lift, the more lower abdominal/pelvic rotation engages the abs. \n4. Eccentric (Downward) Phase: Inhale as you slowly and with control lower your legs back to the starting position, resisting gravity to prevent swinging. \n5. Key Technique: Focus on pulling with your abs, not just your hip flexors, and avoid arching your lower back or using momentum.
