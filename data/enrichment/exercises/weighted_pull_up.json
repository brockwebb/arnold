    "raw_text": "Weighted pull-ups are a compound exercise primarily targeting the back (lats, traps, rhomboids) and arms (biceps, forearms) for pulling strength, involving a vertical pulling motion with scapular retraction and elbow flexion, while also engaging the core and shoulders for stability, making it a powerful full-body movement for building upper body power. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (Back & Arms): \n\n    \u2022 Latissimus Dorsi (Lats): The main muscle for pulling your body up, responsible for shoulder adduction and extension. \n    \u2022 Biceps Brachii: Flexes the elbow to lift your body. \n    \u2022 Forearm Muscles (Brachialis, Brachioradialis): Crucial for grip strength and elbow flexion. \n\n\u2022 Secondary Movers (Shoulders & Upper Back): \n\n    \u2022 Trapezius (Upper, Middle, Lower): Stabilizes and moves the shoulder blades (scapular retraction/depression). \n    \u2022 Rhomboids: Assist in retracting the shoulder blades. \n    \u2022 Posterior Deltoids (Rear Delts): Help with shoulder extension. \n    \u2022 Teres Major: Works with the lats for arm extension. \n\n\u2022 Stabilizers: \n\n    \u2022 Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques): Maintain a stable, straight trunk. \n    \u2022 Rotator Cuff Muscles (e.g., Infraspinatus): Stabilize the shoulder joint. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Starting Position: Hang from the bar with arms extended, engaging your core and keeping shoulders packed down (not shrugging). \n2. Concentric (Pulling) Phase: Pull your body upward by driving your elbows down and back, focusing on pulling with your lats and biceps until your chin is above the bar. \n3. Eccentric (Lowering) Phase: Slowly lower back down with control, extending your arms fully to the starting position. \n4. Compound Movement: It's a vertical pulling, multi-joint exercise that requires significant upper body strength and core stability.
