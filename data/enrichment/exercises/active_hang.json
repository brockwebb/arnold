    "raw_text": "An active hang works the upper back (lats, traps, rhomboids), shoulders, forearms/grip, and core, focusing on straight-arm scapular strength by pulling shoulder blades down and back, building stability for pull-ups and improving posture, unlike a passive hang which just relaxes the shoulders. The pattern is an isometric hold, requiring muscle tension to resist gravity, creating full-body engagement, especially in the shoulder girdle. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Back & Shoulders: Latissimus Dorsi (lats), Trapezius (traps), Rhomboids (scapular retractors). \n\u2022 Grip & Arms: Forearm flexors, hand muscles, biceps, triceps (isometric contraction). \n\u2022 Core: Abdominals and obliques (stabilization). [1, 4, 6]  \n\nMovement Pattern \n\n1. Start: Begin in a passive hang (shoulders relaxed to ears). \n2. Engage: Actively pull your shoulder blades down and away from your ears, as if trying to tuck them into your back pockets. \n3. Hold: Maintain straight arms and tension in your upper back and shoulders, resisting the pull of gravity. \n4. Isolate: Focus on scapular depression and retraction (pulling shoulder blades together and down) while keeping arms straight, not bending elbows. [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  \n\nBenefits \n\n\u2022 Builds foundational strength for pull-ups and chin-ups. \n\u2022 Improves shoulder stability and health, especially for those with injuries. \n\u2022 Increases upper body endurance. \n\u2022 Corrects muscle imbalances.
