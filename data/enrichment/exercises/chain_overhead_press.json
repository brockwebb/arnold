    "raw_text": "The Chain Overhead Press is a variation of the standard overhead press, primarily working the Shoulders (Deltoids), Triceps, and Upper Chest, with significant assistance from the Traps, Serratus Anterior, and Core for stabilization, engaging a vertical pushing movement pattern that builds upper body pushing strength and shoulder health. The chains add accommodating resistance, increasing intensity as you push up, challenging stability more than traditional weights. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers: \n\n    \u2022 Deltoids (Shoulders): Especially the anterior (front) deltoids, responsible for lifting the weight overhead. \n    \u2022 Triceps (Upper Arms): Extend the elbows to lock out the press. \n    \u2022 Pectoralis Major (Upper Chest): Assists in the initial pressing phase. \n\n\u2022 Secondary/Stabilizing Muscles: \n\n    \u2022 Trapezius (Upper Back): Stabilizes the shoulder girdle. \n    \u2022 Serratus Anterior: Helps move the shoulder blade and stabilize the joint. \n    \u2022 Core Muscles (Abs, Obliques, Erector Spinae): Essential for maintaining a rigid torso and preventing excessive arching of the lower back. \n    \u2022 Rotator Cuff: Stabilizes the shoulder joint throughout the movement. [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Pattern (Vertical Pushing) \n\n1. Starting Position: Bar (with chains) at shoulder height, hands gripping the bar, core braced, and glutes squeezed. \n2. Concentric (Pushing) Phase: Drive the weight upward by extending the elbows and shrugging the shoulders slightly, moving the head back as the bar passes the face. \n3. Top Position: Bar directly over the shoulders and mid-foot, arms fully extended. \n4. Eccentric (Lowering) Phase: Control the weight back down to the starting position, maintaining core tension. [6, 7, 8, 9]  \n\nKey Considerations for Chains \n\n\u2022 Accommodating Resistance: As you lift, the chains come off the floor, increasing the resistance and forcing your muscles to work harder at the top of the movement, improving power. \n\u2022 Stability Challenge: The dynamic nature of chains requires more core and shoulder stability compared to a static weight, improving functional strength.
