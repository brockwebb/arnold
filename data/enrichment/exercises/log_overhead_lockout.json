    "raw_text": "The Log Overhead Lockout is an overhead pressing movement pattern and the final static hold of a log lift, involving full elbow and shoulder extension. This position primarily works the triceps and shoulders, with significant engagement of various stabilizing muscles throughout the body. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked \nThe overhead lockout places an immense demand on both prime movers and stabilizers, especially since the log's neutral grip and awkward shape require more stabilization than a standard barbell. \n\n\u2022 Primary Movers (at lockout): \n\n    \u2022 Triceps Brachii: Crucial for the final elbow extension to lock the weight overhead. \n    \u2022 Anterior and Lateral Deltoids: Contract isometrically (and concentrically during the press phase) to hold the load in the overhead position and stabilize the shoulder joint. \n\n\u2022 Synergists and Stabilizers: \n\n    \u2022 Trapezius (Upper, Middle, and Lower): Essential for stabilizing the scapula (shoulder blades) and maintaining an upright posture. \n    \u2022 Rotator Cuff Muscles: Deep shoulder muscles that co-contract to center the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) and provide dynamic joint support and stability. \n    \u2022 Serratus Anterior: Helps with upward rotation and stabilization of the shoulder blade in the overhead position. \n    \u2022 Core Musculature (Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis, Erector Spinae): Engage intensely to stabilize the spine, resist hyperextension (excessive arching) of the lower back, and transfer force effectively. \n    \u2022 Lats (Latissimus Dorsi): Play a role in creating a solid shelf and providing stability in the overhead position. \n    \u2022 Grip/Forearm Flexors: Maintain a strong grip on the log handles. \n    \u2022 Glutes: When standing, glute engagement provides a solid foundation and base for stability. [1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]  \n\nMovement Patterns \nThe primary movement pattern involved in the final lockout phase is isometric contraction and overhead stabilization. \n\n\u2022 Vertical Pressing: The log lockout is the end phase of a vertical pressing movement (e.g., a push press or strict press). \n\u2022 Overhead Stabilization: The core pattern involves holding the heavy load directly above the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, which builds significant functional strength, stability, and endurance. \n\u2022 Elbow Extension: The very last part of the upward drive is a powerful elbow extension, where the triceps finish the movement. \n\u2022 Scapular Upward Rotation and Fixation: The shoulder blades rotate upward and are then fixed in a stable position by the surrounding muscles to support the weight.
