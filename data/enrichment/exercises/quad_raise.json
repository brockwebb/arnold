    "raw_text": "A \"Quad Raise\" (often the Quadruped Leg Raise) primarily targets core/abs, glutes, and hamstrings for stabilization, while the Leg Extension (or seated leg raise) directly works the quadriceps (Rectus Femoris, Vastus Medialis/Lateralis/Intermedius) to extend the knee, with the movement pattern being knee extension, essential for jumping, squatting, and walking. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked \nFor the Quadruped Leg Raise (Stabilization) \n\n\u2022 Core: Rectus Abdominis, Obliques, Transverse Abdominis (deep core). \n\u2022 Glutes: Gluteus Maximus, Medius, Minimus (for hip stability). \n\u2022 Hamstrings: (Synergistically) for stabilizing the knee and hip. [1, 3, 5, 6, 7]  \n\nFor the Leg Extension (Direct Quad Work) \n\n\u2022 Rectus Femoris: Extends knee, flexes hip. \n\u2022 Vastus Medialis: Extends knee, stabilizes kneecap (teardrop muscle). \n\u2022 Vastus Lateralis: Extends knee, creates quad sweep. \n\u2022 Vastus Intermedius: Deepest quad muscle, extends knee. [3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Patterns \n\n\u2022 Quadruped Leg Raise: A stabilization pattern focusing on anti-rotation and maintaining a neutral spine while extending one arm and opposite leg, working core endurance and hip/glute control. \n\u2022 Leg Extension: A classic knee extension pattern, involving straightening the leg at the knee joint (like kicking or standing up) and hip flexion (lifting the thigh) for the rectus femoris. [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]  \n\nKey Difference \n\n\u2022 Quadruped Raise: A core/stability exercise that indirectly involves the quads for stabilization. \n\u2022 Leg Extension: A direct quad isolation exercise focused on building strength and size in the front thigh muscles.
