    "raw_text": "A Sternum-to-Bar Isometric Hold, a variation of the Chest-to-Bar Pull-up, intensely activates your back (lats, rhomboids, traps), biceps, rear delts, forearms, and core (abs/obliques), holding at the top where your sternum touches the bar. This isometric (no movement) hold builds static strength and time under tension, focusing on deep mid-back engagement, scapular stability, and core bracing, making it excellent for developing pulling power for advanced calisthenics. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \nMuscles Worked (Primary & Secondary) \n\n\u2022 Back: Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius (upper/mid). \n\u2022 Arms: Biceps, Brachialis, Brachioradialis (forearms). \n\u2022 Shoulders: Rear Deltoids, Rotator Cuff. \n\u2022 Core: Rectus Abdominis, Transverse Abdominis, Obliques (for torso stability). [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]  \n\nMovement Pattern & Key Focus \n\n1. Isometrics: The hold involves creating tension in the muscles without changing their length (no joint movement). \n2. Scapular Retraction & Depression: You're actively pulling your shoulder blades down and back (retraction) to bring the chest to the bar, engaging the mid-back. \n3. Elbow Flexion & Adduction: Biceps and lats work hard to keep the elbows bent and pulled back towards your body. \n4. Core Bracing: Your abdominals contract to prevent your lower back from arching (lumbar extension), keeping your torso stable. \n5. Time Under Tension: The goal is to hold this peak contraction for a set duration (e.g., 10-30 seconds), building strength in that specific pulling position. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  \n\nHow It Differs from Regular Pull-ups \n\n\u2022 Increased Range of Motion (ROM): Reaching the sternum requires pulling higher than a standard pull-up. \n\u2022 Greater Mid-Back Activation: More focus on upper back and scapular control. \n\u2022 Builds Strength in a Weak Point: Strengthens the top, most challenging part of the pull-up.
