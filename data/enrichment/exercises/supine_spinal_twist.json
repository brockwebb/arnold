    "raw_text": "The Supine Spinal Twist works core muscles (obliques, lower back), glutes, hips, and shoulders while stretching the spine, chest, and hamstrings, improving spinal mobility through a gentle rotation (thoracic and lumbar) and hip release, making it great for tension relief, digestion, and cool-downs. [1, 2, 3, 4]  \nMuscles Worked (Stretched & Engaged) \n\n\u2022 Primary: Obliques (side abs), Lower Back (Quadratus Lumborum - QL). \n\u2022 Secondary: Glutes (especially Piriformis), Hips, Shoulders, Chest, Hamstrings, Abdominal muscles (toned). [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]  \n\nMovement Patterns \n\n\u2022 Spinal Rotation (Torso): The primary movement is a gentle twist or rotation of the thoracic (upper) and lumbar (lower) spine. \n\u2022 Hip External Rotation: The hips rotate as the knees drop to one side. \n\u2022 Core Stabilization: The core muscles (obliques, transverse abdominis) engage to control the movement and keep the upper body stable. \n\u2022 Shoulder Stabilization & Chest Opening: The arms extend, stretching the shoulders and opening the chest. \n\u2022 Gentle Lengthening: Deep stretches occur in the glutes, hips, QL, and hamstrings. [2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]  \n\nKey Benefits \n\n\u2022 Releases tension in the back, hips, and shoulders. \n\u2022 Improves spinal mobility and flexibility. \n\u2022 Massages abdominal organs, aiding digestion. \n\u2022 Aids in relaxation and stress relief. [2, 4, 7, 11]  \n\nHow to Perform (Basic Movement) \n\n1. Lie on your back (supine). \n2. Hug knees to chest or extend arms out to the sides (T-shape). \n3. Slowly drop bent knees to one side, keeping shoulders grounded. \n4. Turn your head away from the knees (optional). \n5. Hold, breathing deeply, then switch sides.
