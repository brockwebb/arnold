The shoulder is held in an overhead abducted/externally rotated lock (isometric) and the elbow is typically extended. Muscles producing the hinge are the gluteus maximus and hamstrings; trunk rotation and lateral flexion are produced by the external/internal obliques, erector spinae and quadratus lumborum; the overhead arm is stabilized by the deltoids, rotator cuff, trapezius and serratus anterior. Because the load is unilateral and the torso must resist unwanted collapse/rotation while moving, the pattern includes both ROTATION (active trunk rotation/lateral flexion) and ANTI_ROTATION (isometric resisting of secondary rotational torque) in addition to the HINGE.",

Primary joint actions are shoulder flexion/abduction in the sagittal/frontal planes; the scapula undergoes upward rotation and posterior tilt (frontal/transverse components). The thoracic spine commonly extends to allow full overhead range. Muscles producing the movement include the anterior/middle deltoids and supraspinatus for arm elevation, with serratus anterior and upper/lower trapezius driving scapular upward rotation and posterior tilt. Rotator cuff muscles act isometrically to center the humeral head. Thoracic extensors assist by allowing spine extension; the elbow typically remains extended/isometric. Stabilization requires scapular and rotator-cuff control to maintain contact/near-contact with the floor and thoracic posture, and tension in the anterior core to keep the ribcage connected to the spine.",

Joint actions vary by specific stretch (spine flexion/extension/rotation, hip and knee flexion/extension, shoulder flexion/abduction, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) and are performed slowly with low force and minimal concentric/plyometric loading. Because there is no dominant primary pattern of loaded joint action (no intentional hinge, squat, push, pull, carry, lunge, locomotion or sustained anti-rotation), it does not map cleanly to the standard movement-pattern taxonomy. Stabilization is typically low-level isometric core and scapular control to protect joints and maintain posture during the stretch.",

Stretches are low-load, often passive or slow active ROM efforts primarily increasing range-of-motion rather than producing high-force concentric/eccentric work; stabilization is low-intensity and distributed across the core and surrounding musculature.",

Muscles producing the limb movements include deltoids, biceps/triceps and rotator cuff; scapular stabilizers (serratus anterior, trapezius) act isometrically for control. Because the technique emphasizes transverse-plane rotary components of the shoulder and cervical segments and coordinated coupling of those rotations with elbow motion, the best-fit movement pattern is ROTATION rather than push/pull/hinge/carry patterns. Stabilization requirements are low-load but require isometric scapular and cervical control to ensure controlled nerve gliding and avoid compensatory trunk movement.",

The finish is a rapid downward/forward drive of the arm and ball (vertical/horizontal component), which functionally resembles a downward/overhead push pattern produced by shoulder extensors and elbow extensors (PUSH). Hips and knees often contribute force via hip extension and triple-extension to generate power; shoulders and elbows produce final ball acceleration and deceleration.

Secondary primary actions include shoulder girdle movement (reaching/gripping, protraction/retraction) and hip-driven roll mechanics (hip flexion/extension) to generate and control the roll. The trunk must both produce rotation (obliques, contralateral erectors) and resist unwanted translational/rotational forces as the bag shifts, requiring strong isometric anti-rotation/stability from the obliques, transverse abdominis and hip stabilizers. Shoulders and scapulae stabilize and reposition the load during each roll, and the hips/glutes provide force to drive the body through the roll while the knees/feet often brace against the ground.",

    "reasoning": "Primary joint action is glenohumeral abduction in the frontal plane produced concentrically by the middle deltoid (with supraspinatus assisting). The movement is an outward/away-from-torso action against resistance which functionally aligns with a shoulder push-type pattern (limb moving away from the body). Scapulothoracic upward rotation and elevation (upper trapezius, serratus anterior) occur as a secondary, coordinated motion. The elbow remains semi-flexed and largely isometric to hold the load; the rotator cuff muscles act isometrically to stabilize the humeral head. Seated position reduces lower-body contribution and momentum, increasing shoulder isolation and scapular stabilization demands.",

    "reasoning": "The tuck crunch is primarily a sagittal-plane trunk-flexion movement with a secondary hip-flexion component when knees are drawn toward the chest. The primary joint motion is lumbar/thoracic spine flexion produced by concentric shortening of the rectus abdominis and assisted by the internal/external obliques; the hip flexors (iliopsoas, rectus femoris) act as secondary movers to bring the femur toward the torso. The hips and knees flex in the sagittal plane to enable the tuck, and the pelvis posteriorly tilts. Stabilization demands include isometric control from the deep core (transversus abdominis) and the erector spinae eccentrically on descent, plus pelvic/hip stabilizers to control pelvis position. Given the available pattern set, HINGE is selected to represent the pronounced sagittal hip flexion component, though the dominant technical action is spinal flexion (trunk curl).",
